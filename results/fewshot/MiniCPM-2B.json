        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 90\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies the time complexity of QuickSort as O(n log n) in the worst case. However, the student could have provided more detail on how the algorithm achieves this time complexity, including the specific steps of the QuickSort algorithm.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (20 points deducted) - The student's answer briefly mentions the time complexity of QuickSort but lacks specific details about how the algorithm achieves this time complexity.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (20 points deducted) - The student's answer is mostly correct but could have provided more detail about how QuickSort achieves its time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (10 points deducted) - The answer could be more clear and detailed to explain how the QuickSort algorithm achieves its time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case.\n\nNote: The student's answer is mostly correct, but it would be helpful to provide more details on how QuickSort achieves its time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case. The student could explain that QuickSort works by dividing the array into two halves and recursively applying the same process to each half. The best case time complexity is O(n log n) when the pivot is chosen well, but the worst case time complexity is O(n\u00b2) when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 20\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student provides a basic explanation of a hash table, mentioning that it stores data and uses keys for indexing. However, the answer lacks details about the specific workings of a hash table, such as the use of a hash function, the process of collision resolution, and the properties of a hash table that make it different from other data structures.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (20 points deducted) - The student's answer is partially correct but lacks important details about how a hash table works.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (20 points deducted) - The student's answer is incomplete and does not cover the key aspects of a hash table's workings, such as the use of a hash function and collision resolution.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (20 points deducted) - The explanation could be clearer and more detailed to provide a better understanding of how a hash table works.\n\nHere's a revised answer with more details and explanations:\n\nA hash table is a data structure that stores data using key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.\n\nWhen a key is inserted into a hash table, it is hashed using a hash function to generate an index into the array of buckets or slots. If the hash function generates a collision (i.e., two keys generate the same index), a collision resolution algorithm is used to determine which bucket to store the value. Common collision resolution algorithms include linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing.\n\nOnce the key-value pair is stored in the hash table, the hash function is used to update the hash table's internal structure to ensure that the hash function is able to generate unique indexes for all keys in the future.\n\nWhen a value is requested from a hash table, the hash function is used to compute the index of the desired value in the array of buckets or slots. If a collision occurs, the hash table uses the collision resolution algorithm to determine the correct bucket to store the value. The value is then retrieved from the appropriate bucket.\n\nIt's important to note that a hash table is not a perfect data structure. Collisions can occur, which can lead to inefficient search times. Additionally, a hash function must be carefully designed to ensure that it generates unique indexes for all keys. However, despite these limitations, hash tables are widely used in many applications due to their efficient search and retrieval times."
