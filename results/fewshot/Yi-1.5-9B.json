        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0 - 25 - 25 - 25 = 0\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that QuickSort operates by dividing the list into two halves, which is a step in the sorting process but does not address the time complexity, a critical aspect of the question.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (25 points deducted) - The student does not address the specific time complexity in the worst case, instead providing the average time complexity for QuickSort, which does not answer the question.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The student's statement about the worst-case time complexity being O(n log n) is incorrect; the correct worst-case time complexity is O(n\u00b2), leading to a significant point deduction for factual inaccuracy.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (25 points deducted) - The answer is not complete as it does not address the pivotal aspect of the question, which is the worst-case time complexity. The student's explanation lacks the crucial detail of how unbalanced partitions lead to the worst-case scenario.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (25 points deducted) - The explanation is not clear as it doesn't explain or justify why dividing the list into halves results in a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case, which is the fundamental misunderstanding that led to all deductions.\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a misunderstanding of both the worst-case time complexity and the mechanism that leads to it in QuickSort. To improve, the student should focus on understanding how the choice of pivot and the partitioning process can affect the efficiency of QuickSort and why the worst-case complexity is O(n\u00b2), not O(n log n)."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 80\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies the basic structure of a hash table as an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (10 points deducted) - The answer does not explicitly mention the role or definition of a hash function, which is a key component in how a hash table works. Also, the student does not address collision resolution, which is crucial to the functionality and efficiency of hash tables.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (10 points deducted) - The explanation lacks detail about how the hash function computes the index into the array of buckets or slots, and how the desired value can be found from there. The answer should be expanded to clarify these concepts for a better understanding.\n\n**Note:** The score is based on the fact that the student has provided the core components of a hash table's working, but the detail and clarity around how the key-value pairs are actually accessed and managed within the hash table were not fully explained."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 50\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student touches upon the concept of multiple computers working together, though it's not explicitly clear that these computers are software components. Basic mention of interaction towards a common goal is a correct aspect.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (25 points deducted) - The answer is not comprehensive in describing the full spectrum of components and their roles in a distributed system. Key elements like servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure are not mentioned, making the answer vague and lacking direction.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (25 points deducted) - The student's answer lacks details on what these connected computers actually do and their functions in a distributed system. Understanding the composition and functionality of each component is crucial to grasp the concept fully.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (5 points deducted) - The explanation lacks a clear and structured approach. The mention of a \"server that manages them\" is not elaborated upon, potentially leading to ambiguity about whether it refers to the communication infrastructure or a single server orchestrating the system.\n\nThe student's answer is partially correct in recognizing the distributed nature but falls short in providing a detailed and comprehensive understanding of the operational components and structure of a distributed system."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 50\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies refactoring as a process in software development. They imply that it involves restructuring to add value to the software.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (25 points deducted) - The student's explanation is not fully aligned with the concept of refactoring, as refactoring doesn't necessarily involve adding new features; it focuses on improving existing code without changing its external behavior.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (25 points deducted) - The explanation lacks detail and clarity about the actual aim of refactoring, which is to improve the code's readability, complexity, maintainability, and scalability, rather than simply adding features as suggested.\n\nRemember, the goal of refactoring is to enhance the quality of software by cleaning up existing code, making it more readable and scalable. It's not about adding new functions. The student correctly identified the domain (software development) but missed the actual purpose of refactoring, leading to significant deductions in relevance and clarity."
