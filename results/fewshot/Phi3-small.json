        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0 - 0 - 25 - 25 = 0\n2. **Positive Feedback:** There is no positive feedback as the answer is incorrect and does not address the question effectively.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (0 points deducted) - The student's answer is not relevant to the question as it states the wrong time complexity for the worst case scenario of QuickSort.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The time complexity mentioned in the student's answer is incorrect for the worst case scenario of QuickSort (O(n log n) is the average-case complexity, not the worst-case).\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (25 points deducted) - The student's answer is incomplete as it fails to mention the conditions in which QuickSort reaches its worst-case scenario (pivot elements being the smallest or largest elements in the array). The answer also should have acknowledged the correct time complexity for the worst case, which is O(n\u00b2)."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 70\n\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies a hash table as an array that stores data, showing a basic understanding of its structure.\n\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (5 points deducted) - Although the student mentions the use of keys for indexing, there is no direct mention of the hash function's role in computing the index.\n\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (10 points deducted) - The student fails to accurately describe the process of how data is stored and accessed within a hash table, which involves hash functions and possible collision resolution.\n\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (20 points deducted) - The answer lacks important details about how keys are hashed to produce indexes and how hash tables handle collisions.\n\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (5 points deducted) - The explanation is overly simplistic and could benefit from more precise language and additional details to fully convey the workings of a hash table."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 15 - 25 - 10 = 50\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that distributed systems involve multiple computers.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (15 points deducted) - The answer mentions some components of a distributed system but does not address all the basic components such as clients, communication infrastructure, and the coordination of components.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The student incorrectly states that the server manages the computers in a distributed system. In reality, the server is one of the components, and the system relies on the communication and coordination between all components.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (10 points deducted) - The student's answer is missing critical details about the components and their interactions in a distributed system, including the concept of clients and the communication infrastructure."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0 - 20 - 25 - 5 = 45\n2. **Positive Feedback:** While the student's answer provides a brief idea of modifying some aspect of the software, there is no recognition of the value of refactoring.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (20 points deducted) - The student's answer does not accurately describe the purpose of refactoring, which is not to add new features but to alter the existing code structure without changing its external behavior.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The answer is factually incorrect as it confuses refactoring with adding new features or functionality to the software.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (0 points deducted) - The score is given for completeness since the student at least addresses the concept of modifying software but completely misses the core idea.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (5 points deducted) - The answer could be more clearly connected with the actual concept of refactoring to convey an understanding of the intent behind the process. However, since the answer is incorrect, this deduction is minor."
