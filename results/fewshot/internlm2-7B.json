        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 25 - 10 - 5 = 60\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies the average time complexity of QuickSort. However, the answer inaccurately states that it is O(n log n) in the worst case, when it should be O(n\u00b2).\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The time complexity of QuickSort in the worst case is stated incorrectly. The student should have said O(n\u00b2) rather than O(n log n).\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (10 points deducted) - The student's answer is still relevant to the question and provides a reasonable explanation, but the incorrect time complexity of the worst case needs to be corrected.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Comprehensiveness (5 points deducted) - While the answer briefly mentions the worst-case scenario, a more detailed explanation of the conditions that lead to O(n\u00b2) time complexity would improve the response."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 25 - 10 - 5 = 60\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student has a basic understanding of hash tables, mentioning that they are an array with keys for indexing.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (25 points deducted) - The student's answer only provides a shallow explanation of what a hash table is and does not explain any of the mechanisms involved that make it work efficiently, such as the use of a hash function or handling collisions.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (10 points deducted) - The student's statement \"A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing\" is technically correct but highly incomplete, as it omits the critical role of the hash function and how collisions are dealt with.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (5 points deducted) - The response lacks the necessary details about how a hash table functions, such as how the hash function is used to map keys to indices and how collisions are resolved.\n\nNote: While the student's answer touched on the topic, it lacked the deep understanding and specific details that the question asked for, resulting in lower grades in relevance, accuracy, and completeness. The response required more depth in explaining the concepts of how hash tables work, particularly mentioning the role of the hash function and collision resolution."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 50 - 15 - 10 - 15 = 30\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student does correctly identify that a distributed system involves multiple computers and a server for management. However, the explanation lacks depth and does not mention key components.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (15 points deducted) - The student's answer does not directly address all the parts in the question, specifically the communication infrastructure.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (10 points deducted) - The term \"server\" in the student's answer only refers to the management component while in the reference answer, it also includes the server as a communicating component.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (15 points deducted) - The answer omits the clients and communication infrastructure, which are central components of a distributed system.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (0 points deducted) - The explanation is clear and understandable."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 15 - 25 - 20 = 40\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student identifies that refactoring involves rewriting code but focuses on adding new features, which is only a small aspect of refactoring. However, they do not mention the primary purpose of refactoring, which is to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (15 points deducted) - The student's answer does not accurately address the primary purpose of refactoring, which is to improve the nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or maintainability.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (20 points deducted) - The explanation could be expanded to better explain the difference between adding new features and refactoring, as well as the benefits of refactoring in terms of improving the overall quality of the software."
