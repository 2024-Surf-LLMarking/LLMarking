        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "- **Question:** What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst-case scenario?\n- **Reference Answer:** In the worst-case scenario, when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest elements in the array, the time complexity of QuickSort becomes O(n^2), where 'n' is the number of elements in the array. This occurs due to unbalanced partitions, leading to repeated comparisons and swaps within each partition.\n- **Student Answer:** QuickSort typically exhibits a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case. This is because QuickSort divides the list into two halves, and the division step is performed log(n) times, where 'n' is the number of elements. However, in the worst case, where the pivot elements severely disfavor one side of the list, QuickSort can degrade to O(n^2) time complexity.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 75\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identified the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort as O(n^2), understanding the concept of unbalanced partitions and their impact on the algorithm's performance. They also provided a brief explanation of how the division step contributes to the log(n) factor.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (5 points deducted): The student touched on the relevant concept but could have provided a more concise and accurate explanation, focusing specifically on the worst-case scenario and the factors contributing to the O(n^2) time complexity.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (5 points deducted): While the student mentioned the log(n) factor, they lacked an explanation of how it relates to the division step and the division's impact on the algorithm's efficiency.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (10 points deducted): A thorough explanation of QuickSort's time complexity in the worst case should include a more detailed discussion of the pivot \u0627\u0646\u062a\u062e\u0627\u0628's influence on partition imbalance and the subsequent O(n^2) growth in comparison to the average case O(n log n) efficiency.\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept but could be improved by providing a more comprehensive and accurate explanation, ensuring all relevant aspects are addressed, and focusing on the specific influences contributing to the worst-case time complexity."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "- **Question:** Explain how a hash table works.\n- **Reference Answer:** A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to store and retrieve data efficiently. It operates by computing an index from a key, which is then used to store or retrieve the associated value from an array of buckets or slots. This design minimizes the time required to search for a value, making it efficient for many applications. Additionally, hash tables can employ techniques like chaining or open addressing to handle collisions, where different keys are mapped to the same index.\n- **Student Answer:** A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 25 - 15 - 15 - 10 - 10 = 50\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student provided a concise and correct understanding of what a hash table is and how it uses keys for indexing.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (25 points deducted) - While the student touched on the basic concept, they did not explain how hash tables work, including the details of the hash function and indexing process, which are crucial to understanding the topic.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (15 points deducted) - The student's answer is incomplete as it fails to mention the purpose of the hash function and how it computes indices. Additionally, they do not mention how hash tables handle collisions, which is a significant aspect of their design.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (15 points deducted) - The student's response lacks critical details about the inner workings of a hash table, including the hash function and how it maps keys to indices. It also does not address collision resolution techniques, which are an essential part of the topic.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (10 points deducted) - The explanation is simple but lacks the necessary depth to fully convey the complexities of hash table design and functionality.\n\nPlease note that the deductions are based on the provided reference answer and the expected level of understanding for the given question."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "- **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 20 - 15 - 5 = 70\n- **Positive Feedback:** The student provides a concise and accurate definition of refactoring, understanding its role in software development. They recognize that refactoring affects internal code structure without altering external behavior.\n- **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (20 points deducted) - While the student understands the basic concept, they failed to address the non-functional attributes mentioned in the reference answer, such as improved readability and maintainability. Refactoring can also involve restructuring code to enhance these attributes, which is an important aspect.\n- **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (15 points deducted) - The student's statement is partial in accuracy. Refactoring not only involves writing new functions but also modifying existing code to improve its structure and design. It's a process that encompasses a range of programming techniques to enhance the code's internal design while preserving its external functionality.\n- **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (5 points deducted) - The answer lacks a comprehensive understanding of refactoring's scope. While the student mentions improved readability, they don't elaborate on other non-functional benefits, such as reduced complexity and improved maintainability and scalability, which are crucial aspects of refactoring.\n- **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (5 points deducted) - The explanation could be more detailed to better illustrate the range of techniques involved in refactoring. Clarifying that refactoring doesn't solely involve adding functions but also involves a variety of restructuring methods would provide a more accurate understanding of the concept."
