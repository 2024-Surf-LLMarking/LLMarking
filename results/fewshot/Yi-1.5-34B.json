        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 25 - 25 - 25 = 25\n2. **Positive Feedback:** None can be confidently identified based on the incorrect information provided.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The student incorrectly states the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort as O(n log n). The correct worst-case time complexity is O(n\u00b2).\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (25 points deducted) - The answer lacks any explanation of why the worst-case scenario leads to O(n\u00b2) complexity, which is essential for understanding the implications of the pivot selection in QuickSort.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (25 points deducted) - The explanation is misleading and incomplete, as it does not mention the pivot element's role in determining the time complexity.\n\nThe student's answer contains significant inaccuracies and lacks clarity and completeness, leading to a very low final score."

        "topic": "Data Structures",
        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0 - 25 - 50 - 0 = 0\n2. **Positive Feedback:** N/A - The student's response does not provide a coherent explanation of how a hash table works.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (25 points deducted) - The student completely fails to mention the key aspects of a hash table, including the use of a hash function, indexing, and buckets.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The statement \"... an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing\" is inaccurate and overly simplistic, as it does not mention the crucial hash function and the mechanism of computing indexes from keys.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (50 points deducted) - The answer is not complete as it omits the essential parts of a hash table's operation, including hash function calculation, indexing, and collision resolution.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (25 points deducted) - The explanation is not clear or informative, offering a misleading simplification of the hash table's functionality.\n\nThe student's answer is highly inaccurate and incomplete, providing no useful information on how a hash table operates."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 = 0\n2. **Positive Feedback:** N/A\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (25 points deducted) - The student does not address any of the key components of a distributed system, only mentioning the concept of multiple computers connected to a server. This response fails to capture the essence of distributed systems, such as the distributed software components, communication, and coordination among them.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The accuracy of the student's answer is poor, as it oversimplifies the complexity of distributed systems and does not mention the critical aspects of distributed software components and their interaction.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (25 points deducted) - The answer lacks any reference to the communication infrastructure, servers, clients, or the message passing between components that are essential to understanding the functionality of a distributed system.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (25 points deducted) - The explanation is overly simplistic and fails to provide any clarity on the concept of distributed systems, leaving out crucial details that define their nature and operation."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0\n2. **Positive Feedback:** N/A\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (0 points) - The student's answer does not address the core concept of refactoring, which is about restructuring the code without changing its external behavior. Instead, the answer incorrectly focuses on adding features, which is not the primary goal of refactoring.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (0 points) - The provided definition of refactoring is inaccurate. It does not mention the key aspect that refactoring involves changing the code structure without altering its external functionality.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (0 points) - The student's answer omits the important motivations for refactoring, such as improving readability and maintainability, which are essential components of the concept.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (0 points) - The explanation is not clear as it does not correctly differentiate refactoring from other development activities like adding new features."
