        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "\n1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 75\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is the average case complexity. This shows a good understanding of the algorithm's typical performance.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (10 points deducted) - The student's answer incorrectly states that the worst-case time complexity is O(n log n), when in fact it is O(n\u00b2). This is a significant error that misrepresents the worst-case scenario for QuickSort.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (5 points deducted) - The student's answer does not address the specific conditions that lead to the worst-case scenario, which is when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, resulting in unbalanced partitions.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (5 points deducted) - The explanation could be clearer by directly stating the worst-case time complexity and providing a brief description of the conditions that lead to it."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "\n1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 15 - 20 - 10 = 55\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student has correctly identified that a hash table is an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing, which is a fundamental aspect of how hash tables operate.\n\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (15 points deducted) - The student's answer lacks the explanation of the hash function, which is crucial for understanding how a hash table determines the index for storing and retrieving data. Additionally, the student did not mention the concept of buckets or slots, which are integral to the structure of a hash table.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (20 points deducted) - The answer omits details about the hash table's efficiency in terms of time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations, which are typically O(1) under ideal conditions. It also does not address the issue of collisions and the methods used to resolve them, such as chaining or open addressing.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (10 points deducted) - The explanation is brief and lacks the necessary detail to be considered clear. It could be improved by elaborating on the hash function and the collision resolution process."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "\n1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 60\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that distributed systems involve multiple computers connected to a server. This is a good start as it captures the essence of the concept of a distributed system.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (5 points deducted) - The answer does not fully address the communication aspect of distributed systems, which is crucial to understanding how these systems operate and coordinate actions.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (15 points deducted) - The student's answer omits important components of a distributed system, such as clients and the communication infrastructure, which are essential for a comprehensive understanding.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (10 points deducted) - The explanation is overly simplistic and does not provide a clear distinction between servers and clients or describe the communication infrastructure in detail. This could lead to misunderstandings about how a distributed system functions."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "\n1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 20 - 20 - 40 = 20\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly recognizes that refactoring involves modifying code, which is an aspect of the process.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (20 points deducted) - The student's answer does not address the primary focus of refactoring, which is to improve the internal structure and nonfunctional attributes of the code without changing its external behavior.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (20 points deducted) - The student's definition of refactoring inaccurately suggests that the purpose is to add features, whereas refactoring is meant to improve the code without altering its functionality.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (20 points deducted) - The student's answer does not mention the nonfunctional attributes such as readability, reduced complexity, maintainability, and scalability, which are key aspects of refactoring. \n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (40 points deducted) - The explanation is vague and does not provide a clear understanding of what refactoring entails in software development."
