        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0 - 50 - 40 - 10 = 0\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student identifies that QuickSort has a time complexity related to the size of the array.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (50 points deducted) - The student's answer incorrectly states that the time complexity is O(n log n) in the worst case, which is accurate only for the average case; in the worst case, it is O(n\u00b2).\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (40 points deducted) - The student incorrectly states that the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort is O(n log n), which is the average-case complexity.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (10 points deducted) - The answer does not provide any context for why the worst-case time complexity is O(n\u00b2), nor does it explain under which conditions the worst case arises. The answer would be more complete by addressing these aspects.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (0 points deducted) - The answer is concise and to the point but inaccurate, making it unclear for the reader. The answer could be improved by emphasizing the distinction between the average-case and worst-case complexities."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 50 - 30 - 10 - 10 = 50\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that a hash table stores key-value pairs, and that hash tables use keys for indexing.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (30 points deducted) - The student's answer is brief and doesn't cover crucial parts of the reference answer regarding the use of a hash function to compute an index and the different designs for collision resolution.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (10 points deducted) - The explanation is lacking in the way it fails to mention the crucial role of the hash function and the resolution of collisions in a hash table's functioning.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (10 points deducted) - The answer could be more detailed to explain how hash functions determine indexing and what might occur when collisions take place. To provide a more accurate understanding of hash tables, it would be beneficial to expand on the concepts of ideal unique assignments to buckets and the various methods for collision resolution."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 67\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that a distributed system comprises multiple computers, and that these systems have a server for management.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (3 points deducted) - The answer lacks adequate explanation of the components of a distributed system. The definition provided is broad, but it needs to mention clients and the communication infrastructure as well.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (13 points deducted) - The answer does not address the key aspect of how the distributed system achieves its common goal through communication between software components, nor does it explain the role of the communication infrastructure.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (5 points deducted) - The explanation could be expanded to provide more detail about what happens between the computers and the server in order to achieve the common goal in a distributed system.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (2 points deducted) - The answer should specify that the server does not \"manage\" the other computers, but rather coordinates their actions and communication."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 33\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student acknowledges the term \"refactoring\" in the context of software development.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (25 points deducted) - The student's answer does not align with the definition provided as refactoring is not about adding new functions to add features; rather, it involves modifying the existing code to improve non-functional attributes without affecting the code's functionality.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The student's statement is incorrect as refactoring is about modifying existing code, not writing new functions for additional features. This mistake significantly impacts the accuracy of the answer.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (25 points deducted) - The student's answer overlooks crucial aspects of refactoring, such as improving readability, reducing complexity, and enhancing maintainability and scalability.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (12 points deducted) - The student's explanation could be improved by providing a clear distinction between refactoring and other activities in software development like adding features, and explaining the purpose of refactoring in more detail."
