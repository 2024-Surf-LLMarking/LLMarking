        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0\n2. **Positive Feedback:** None applicable; the answer provided is incorrect and lacks clarity.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (0 points deducted) - The answer does not address the question asked about the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (0 points deducted) - The student incorrectly states the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort as O(n log n), which is the average and best-case scenario, not the worst-case scenario.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (0 points deducted) - The answer does not provide any additional information that might be relevant to the topic, such as an explanation of why this is not the worst-case time complexity.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (0 points deducted) - The explanation is vague and incorrect, failing to provide a clear understanding of the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 10 - 20 - 10 = 60\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that a hash table is an array used for storing data. This part of the answer is accurate and relevant.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (10 points deducted) - While mentioning that a hash table is an array is correct, the student does not explain how keys are used for indexing, which is a crucial aspect of hash table functionality.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (20 points deducted) - The student's answer lacks detail about the role of the hash function in computing indices, the concept of buckets or slots, and the mechanism of collision resolution, which are essential components of how a hash table operates.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (10 points deducted) - The explanation could be improved for clarity by providing a more detailed description of how keys are used in conjunction with the hash function to access values within the array, and by mentioning the importance of collision resolution strategies in managing multiple keys that may hash to the same index."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 25 - 15 - 15 = 45\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that a distributed system involves multiple computers, which is a fundamental aspect of the concept.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (25 points deducted) - The answer does not fully address the components of a distributed system. It incorrectly suggests that there is only one server managing the computers, which contradicts the essence of distributed systems where components work independently yet collaboratively.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (15 points deducted) - The student fails to mention critical components such as clients, which are also essential parts of a distributed system.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (15 points deducted) - The answer lacks clarity and precision. It does not specify that these components communicate and coordinate their actions, which is a key characteristic of distributed systems."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 10 - 20 - 10 = 60\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student acknowledges that refactoring involves modifying the structure of the code, which is related to the reference answer's concept of changing the factoring of the code.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (10 points deducted) - The student's answer is not entirely accurate because it focuses on adding features through refactoring, which is not the primary goal of refactoring. The student should have mentioned that the main objective is to improve the code's structure and quality without altering its functionality.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (20 points deducted) - The student's answer lacks detail about the nonfunctional attributes of software that can be improved through refactoring, such as readability, complexity, maintainability, and scalability. A complete answer should explain these aspects.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (10 points deducted) - The explanation is vague and does not provide a clear understanding of what refactoring truly entails in software development. A clearer explanation would include the intent behind refactoring and its benefits beyond just adding features."
