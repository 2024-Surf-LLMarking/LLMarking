        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 25 - 25 - 25 = 25\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student states that QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is the average-case time complexity, not the worst-case.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The student's answer is incorrect; QuickSort's worst-case time complexity is indeed O(n\u00b2), not O(n log n).\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (25 points deducted) - The student's answer does not address the specific condition under which the worst-case occurs, which is when the pivot elements consistently result in unbalanced partitions.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (25 points deducted) - The explanation is unclear about why the worst-case scenario leads to O(n\u00b2) complexity, which is a crucial aspect of understanding the algorithm's behavior."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 15 - 25 - 10 = 50\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that a hash table uses an array for storage and keys for indexing, which is a basic aspect of its operation.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (15 points deducted) - The answer lacks depth and fails to explain how a hash table works beyond the basic structure. It does not mention the hash function or collision resolution, which are essential components of a hash table's functionality.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The reference answer specifies that a hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, which the student's answer omits. This is a crucial part of the hashing process and its efficiency.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (10 points deducted) - The student's answer does not cover the full process of how a hash table operates, such as the role of the hash function and the need for collision resolution when multiple keys map to the same index.\n\nIn summary, the student's answer provides a basic understanding of the structure of a hash table but falls short in explaining its key mechanisms, making it incomplete and less accurate."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 50 - 15 - 15 - 10 = 10\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student mentions that distributed systems consist of multiple computers connected to a server, which is a basic aspect of the concept. However, the answer is incomplete and lacks clarity.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (15 points deducted) - The student's answer only focuses on the server aspect, neglecting to address the other essential components mentioned in the reference answer (clients and communication infrastructure).\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (15 points deducted) - The student's answer omits the key components of clients and the communication infrastructure, which are crucial for understanding the functioning of a distributed system.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (10 points deducted) - The response is vague and does not explain how these components work together or their roles in achieving a common goal, as described in the reference answer."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 15 - 15 - 10 = 50\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student acknowledges the act of adding new functions as part of refactoring, which is correct to an extent.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (15 points deducted) - The student's answer focuses primarily on adding new features, which is only one aspect of refactoring. It fails to address the broader concept of restructuring code without changing its external behavior.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (15 points deducted) - The student's answer lacks details on the purpose of refactoring beyond adding features, such as improving code quality, maintainability, and scalability.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (10 points deducted) - The answer could benefit from a clearer explanation of the concept and its objectives, as well as the connection between adding new functions and the broader refactoring process."
