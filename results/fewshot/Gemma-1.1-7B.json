        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "**Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 25\n\n**Positive Feedback:**\n\n- The student correctly identifies that QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average and best cases.\n\n\n**Deduction Reasons:**\n\n- **Relevance (25 points deducted):** The student's answer does not address the specifically mentioned worst-case time complexity of O(n\u00b2) for QuickSort. \n- The answer lacks nuance and fails to explain the crucial factor of unbalanced partitioning leading to the worst-case time complexity of O(n\u00b2)."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "**Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 20\n\n**Positive Feedback:**\n- The student correctly identifies that a hash table uses keys for indexing data.\n\n**Deduction Reasons:**\n\n1. **Relevance (30 points deducted):** The student's answer lacks explanation on how hash tables store key-value pairs or how they utilize hash functions to compute indexes.\n2. **Accuracy (20 points deducted):** The statement that a hash table is just an array is inaccurate; it implies a naive implementation that does not address the crucial aspects of collision resolution and key-value pair storage.\n3. **Completeness (20 points deducted):** The answer is lacking in depth and does not explain how hash tables efficiently locate values based on keys.\n4. **Clarity (30 points deducted):** The explanation is overly simplistic and lacks necessary details to illustrate the working of a hash table, including the role of hash functions and collision resolution strategies."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "**Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 30\n\n**Positive Feedback:**\n\n- The student correctly identifies that a distributed system consists of multiple computers connected to a server.\n\n\n**Deduction Reason:**\n\n- **Relevance (20 points deducted)**: The answer lacks crucial details about the different software components and their interactions in a distributed system. The student's response only describes a basic connection between computers and a server, ignoring the communication and coordination aspects essential to distributed systems.\n- **Completeness (10 points deducted)**: The answer lacks expansion on the key components of a distributed system, such as servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n- The student's answer lacks elaboration on the roles and functions of different components in a distributed system.\n- It does not elaborate on the importance of communication infrastructure in facilitating coordination and interaction between components.\n- The response does not provide examples or further details about commonly used distributed systems, which could enhance the clarity and comprehensiveness of the answer."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "**Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 30\n\n**Positive Feedback:**\n\n- The student correctly identifies that refactoring involves restructuring existing code without altering its functionality.\n\n**Deduction Reasons:**\n\n**1. Relevance (30 points deducted):**\n- The student's answer deviates significantly from the question's focus on code restructuring for nonfunctional enhancements.\n- The definition provided relates to adding new features, which is not the primary aim of refactoring.\n\n**2. Accuracy (0 points deducted):**\n- The answer is factually correct and aligns with the reference answer.\n\n**3. Completeness (0 points deducted):**\n- The student's answer lacks crucial details about the purpose and benefits of refactoring.\n\n**4. Clarity (0 points deducted):**\n- The explanation is ambiguous and does not convey the essence of refactoring clearly. It lacks specific examples or descriptions of how refactoring enhances code quality."
