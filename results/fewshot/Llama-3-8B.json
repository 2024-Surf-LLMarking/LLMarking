        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 0 - 30 - 20 = 50\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies the QuickSort algorithm, but the answer lacks accuracy and completeness.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (30 points deducted) - The student's answer states that the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n log n) in the worst case, which is incorrect. The correct answer is O(n\u00b2) in the worst case, as mentioned in the reference answer.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (20 points deducted) - The student's answer does not provide any explanation or details about why the worst-case scenario occurs or how it affects the algorithm's performance.\n\nNote: The student's answer only mentions that QuickSort divides the list into two halves, which is a minor aspect of the algorithm, but does not address the time complexity in the worst case."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "**Question:** Explain how a hash table works.\n**Reference Answer:** A hash table stores key-value pairs.

It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
