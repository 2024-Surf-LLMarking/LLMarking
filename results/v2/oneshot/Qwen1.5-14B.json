        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, <Point1:3>the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n^2)<Point1:3>, where n is the number of elements in the array. <Point2:2>This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array<Point2:2>, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "teacherMark": "<Point1:0> <Deduction>,<Point2:0> <Deduction>",
        "feedback": "<Point1:3> *False* (The student's answer incorrectly states that the worst-case time complexity is O(n log n), while the correct answer is O(n^2).)\n\n<Point2:2> *False* (The explanation for the worst-case scenario is incorrect. The student does not mention the condition of consistently choosing the smallest or largest element as the pivot.)\n\nTotal score: 0 / 5"
