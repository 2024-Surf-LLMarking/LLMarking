        "fullMark": "5",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, <Point1:3>the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n^2)<Point1:3>, where n is the number of elements in the array. <Point2:2>This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array<Point2:2>, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "teacherMark": "<Point1:0> <Deduction>,<Point2:0> <Deduction>",
        "feedback": "<Point1:3> *False* (The student's answer mentions the average and best-case scenarios but does not address the worst-case scenario, which is when the pivot element is already in the correct position, resulting in partitions of size n.)\n\n<Point2:2> *False* (While it is true that unbalanced partitions can lead to a worst-case time complexity, the student's answer does not provide the specific reason for the O(n^2) complexity.)\n\nTotal score: 1 / 5"
