        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "fullMark": "5",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, <Point1:3>the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n^2)<Point1:3>, where n is the number of elements in the array. <Point2:2>This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array<Point2:2>, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "teacherMark": "<Point1:0> <Deduction>,<Point2:0> <Deduction>",
        "feedback": "**Point:3** The student's answer partially satisfies the point. The student correctly identifies that the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n^2) in the worst case, but does not provide the correct reason for this. The student's answer does not mention the scenario where the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.\n\n**Point:0** The student's answer does not satisfy this point. The student claims that QuickSort divides the list into two halves, which is not the reason for the O(n^2) time complexity in the worst case.\n\nTotal score: 3/5"

        "referenceAnswer": "<Point1:2>A hash table stores key-value pairs<Point1:2>. <Point2:2>It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found<Point2:2>. <Point3:1>Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution<Point3:1>.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",

        "feedback": "**Feedback:**\n\n<Point:2>Induction...The student's answer correctly identifies that a hash table stores key-value pairs and uses keys for indexing, which is the core concept of a hash table. The student has grasped the basic idea of how a hash table works.\n\n<Point:0>Deduction...The student's answer lacks details about the hash function and collision resolution, which are crucial aspects of how a hash table works. The student's answer is too simplistic and does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\nTotal score: 2/5"
