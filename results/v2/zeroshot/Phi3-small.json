        "fullMark": "5",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, <Point1:3>the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n^2)<Point1:3>, where n is the number of elements in the array. <Point2:2>This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array<Point2:2>, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "teacherMark": "<Point1:0> <Deduction>,<Point2:0> <Deduction>",
        "feedback": "<Point1:0>Deduction: The reference point clearly states that the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort is O(n^2), not O(n log n). The student incorrectly identified the worst-case time complexity.<Point1:0>\n\n<Point2:0>Deduction: The student didn't mention the reason for the worst-case time complexity, which involves the choice of pivot elements leading to unbalanced partitions.<Point2:0>\n\nTotal score: 0/5"

        "fullMark": "5",
        "referenceAnswer": "<Point1:2>A hash table stores key-value pairs<Point1:2>. <Point2:2>It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found<Point2:2>. <Point3:1>Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution<Point3:1>.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "teacherMark": "<Point1:2> <Induction>,<Point2:0> <Deduction>,<Point3:0> <Deduction>",
        "feedback": "<Point3:0>Deduction: The student's answer does not mention the crucial role of the hash function in computing an index, nor does it explain the concept of collision resolution. These are key elements that distinguish a hash table from a simple array.\n<Point1:1>Induction: The student correctly identifies that a hash table stores data using keys.\n\nTotal score: 1/5"
