        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, <Point1:3>the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n^2)<Point1:3>, where n is the number of elements in the array. <Point2:2>This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array<Point2:2>, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",

        "feedback": "<Point1:3> The student mentions that QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case, but the reference answer states that in the worst case, it is O(n^2). The student is incorrect on this point.\n\n<Point2:2> The student does not mention the cause of the worst-case scenario (i.e., consistently choosing the smallest or largest element as the pivot) that leads to unbalanced partitions. The reference answer correctly states this condition.\n\nTotal score: 0/5"

        "feedback": "<Point1:2> The student correctly describes that a hash table is an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing, but this explanation lacks detail; it doesn't mention how the hash function is used for computing the index or the concept of buckets or slots. So, no induction on this point. <|im_start|>\n\n<Point2:2> Although the student understands that there is a hash function involved in computing the index, the explanation lacks the necessary depth. The student does not describe the purpose of these buckets or the process of obtaining the desired value. Thus, no induction on this point. <|im_start|>\n\n<Point3:1> The student does not mention any aspect of collision resolution, which is a crucial element of hash table operation.
