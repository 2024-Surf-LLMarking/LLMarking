        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, <Point1:3>the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n^2)<Point1:3>, where n is the number of elements in the array. <Point2:2>This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array<Point2:2>, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",

        "feedback": "<Point1:0> <Deduction>The student answer does not correctly state the worst-case time complexity as O(n^2), instead, they mention O(n log n) which is the average case.<Point1:0>\n<Point2:0> <Deduction>The student does not mention the condition for the worst case, i.e., consistent selection of the smallest or largest element as the pivot.<Point2:0>\nTotal score: 0/5"
