        "fullMark": "5",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, <Point1:3>the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n^2)<Point1:3>, where n is the number of elements in the array. <Point2:2>This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array<Point2:2>, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "teacherMark": "<Point1:0> <Deduction>,<Point2:0> <Deduction>",
        "feedback": "3 <Induction>The student correctly identified that QuickSort divides the list into two halves, which is a key aspect of its efficiency. However, they misstated the worst-case time complexity, which should be O(n^2), not O(n log n).</Induction>\n<Point:2>Deduction>The student's mistake in stating the time complexity as O(n log n) instead of O(n^2) leads to a deduction in points. This is because the worst-case scenario for QuickSort, as described in the reference answer, is indeed O(n^2), not O(n log n).</Point:2>\nTotal score: 1/5"
