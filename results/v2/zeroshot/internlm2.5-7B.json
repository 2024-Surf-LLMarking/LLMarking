        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, <Point1:3>the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n^2)<Point1:3>, where n is the number of elements in the array. <Point2:2>This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array<Point2:2>, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "teacherMark": "<Point1:0> <Deduction>,<Point2:0> <Deduction>",
        "feedback": "<Point1:3> *False* (reason, The student claims that the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort is O(n log n), but according to the reference answer, it should be O(n^2) when the pivot always chooses the smallest or largest element, causing unbalanced partitions.)\n\n<Point2:3> *True* (reason, The reference answer correctly states that the best-case time complexity of QuickSort is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot always divides the list into two equal parts, leading to balanced partitions and optimal performance.)\n\nTotal score: 1 / 5"

        "referenceAnswer": "<Point1:2>A hash table stores key-value pairs<Point1:2>. <Point2:2>It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found<Point2:2>. <Point3:1>Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution<Point3:1>.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "teacherMark": "<Point1:2> <Induction>,<Point2:0> <Deduction>,<Point3:0> <Deduction>",
        "feedback": "<Point1:2> *True* (The student correctly describes a hash table's primary function, which is to store key-value pairs. This is fundamental to how a hash table works.)\n\n<Point2:2> *True* (The student is accurate in stating that a hash function is used to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots. This is a critical part of hash table implementation.)\n\n<Point3:2> *True* (The student is correct in acknowledging the ideal scenario where the hash function assigns each key to a unique bucket. Although they don't mention collision resolution, their understanding is valid as it's usually a part of most hash table designs.)\n\nTotal score: 3 / 5"
