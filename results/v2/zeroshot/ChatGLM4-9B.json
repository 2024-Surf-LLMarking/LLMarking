        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, <Point1:3>the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n^2)<Point1:3>, where n is the number of elements in the array. <Point2:2>This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array<Point2:2>, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",

The correct answer is O(n^2) as stated in the reference answer.)\n\n<Point2:2> *False* (The student's explanation for the time complexity does not address the issue of pivot selection causing unbalanced partitions, which is a key factor in the worst-case scenario.)\n\nTotal score: 0 / 5"
