The rail ticket is issued and charged to their credit \ncard account. To begin, the user presses the start button. The system activates a menu displaying the potential destinations and sends a message to the user to select a destination. Once the user selects a destination, the system requests the user to insert his credit card. The system checks the credit card validity and requires the user to input a personal identifier. When the credit transaction is validated by the credit card center, the ticket is issued. If the user enters an invalid personal identifier for the credit card, the system will prompt the user and terminate the transaction. Apart from the \u201cuser\u201d, who is the second actor in the requirement?",

All risks and opportunities must be well defined and specific.\n 2.Risk assessment. The second step is to assess the risks and opportunities and classify them into  two different kinds, Quantitative and Qualitative. Quantitative is about the financial risks and  benefits and qualitative is about the probability of risks happening and the impact.\n 3.Risk treatment. The third step is to identify strategies against the risks they may face by creating  a treatment plan. The main theme of the plan focuses on how to reduce the probability of risks events happening and how to reduce their impact, for opportunity is plan to increase the chance and increase the positive impact.\n4.Risk monitoring and reporting. The fourth step is to report about the risks and opportunities listed on the treatment plan. The frequency of reporting depends on how big the risk is. Monitoring and reporting can make sure the project team is informed and can deal with the problem at the fastest speed before things get any worse. \n",
