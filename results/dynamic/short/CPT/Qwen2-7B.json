        "studentAnswer": "The Waterfall and Agile models are distinct approaches to software development. The Waterfall model is known for being a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. This doesn't mean that every phase can't have its own completion, but it isn't true that phases overlap or iterate once they start. Changes in the Waterfall model are notoriously difficult to implement because it requires revisiting and potentially redoing previous phases, which isn't to say that changes can't be made, but it's rare and not without significant effort. In contrast, the Agile model adopts an iterative and incremental approach, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It's not that Agile can't incorporate feedback at every stage, but it doesn't mean that all feedback is integrated seamlessly without any issues. Agile allows for continuous feedback from stakeholders and adaptability to changing requirements throughout the development process, which isn't to say that changes are never challenging, but it doesn't deny the possibility of making them at any stage.",

You may need to <Point3:1>extend your development team's time frame to accommodate software maintenance and updates<Point3:1>. Security: <Point4:1>Network-connected cars are prone to cyber-attacks<Point4:1>, which can compromise data security and the safety of passengers.

Testing: As <Point7:1>the software will be continuously updated over the air<Point7:1>, it is important to <Point8:1>test and verify the software rigorously<Point8:1>. <Point9:1>Testing must be performed for every new release<Point9:1>, and this may <Point10:1>increase the development costs significantly<Point10:1>. Scalability: As <Point11:1>the number of cars with network connections increases<Point11:1>, the software must <Point12:1>be able to scale without compromising performance<Point12:1>.
