System Analysis and Design: In this phase, the requirements are analyzed and a blueprint of the system is created. Although creating a blueprint doesn\u2019t mean no design flaws will ever be present, it\u2019s not impossible that some issues won\u2019t be detected until later stages. Implementation (Coding): Here, the code is written according to the design documents. It\u2019s not that writing code guarantees no bugs will exist, but it doesn\u2019t mean that the code will be bug-free either. Testing: The system is verified against the requirements to identify and fix defects.

        "studentAnswer": "The Waterfall and Agile models are distinct approaches to software development. The Waterfall model is known for being a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. This doesn't mean that every phase can't have its own completion, but it isn't true that phases overlap or iterate once they start. Changes in the Waterfall model are notoriously difficult to implement because it requires revisiting and potentially redoing previous phases, which isn't to say that changes can't be made, but it's rare and not without significant effort. In contrast, the Agile model adopts an iterative and incremental approach, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It's not that Agile can't incorporate feedback at every stage, but it doesn't mean that all feedback is integrated seamlessly without any issues. Agile allows for continuous feedback from stakeholders and adaptability to changing requirements throughout the development process, which isn't to say that changes are never challenging, but it doesn't deny the possibility of making them at any stage.",

        "studentAnswer": "Strong typing and weak typing refer to how strictly a programming language enforces type rules. Weak typing checks the types of variables at runtime, allowing for more flexibility but potentially leading to more bugs. On the other hand, strong typing checks the types of variables at compile time, which can help reduce bugs but can make the code more rigid and harder to modify. While strong typing might seem restrictive, it does not mean that it is not beneficial for reducing bugs. However, the decision ultimately depends on your project requirements. If flexibility is a priority and the project can tolerate potential runtime errors, weak typing might be suitable. Conversely, for projects where minimizing bugs is critical, strong typing would be the recommended approach.",
