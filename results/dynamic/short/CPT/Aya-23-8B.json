System Analysis and Design: In this phase, the requirements are analyzed and a blueprint of the system is created. Although creating a blueprint doesn\u2019t mean no design flaws will ever be present, it\u2019s not impossible that some issues won\u2019t be detected until later stages. Implementation (Coding): Here, the code is written according to the design documents. It\u2019s not that writing code guarantees no bugs will exist, but it doesn\u2019t mean that the code will be bug-free either. Testing: The system is verified against the requirements to identify and fix defects. Even if testing doesn\u2019t catch every defect, it doesn\u2019t mean that critical bugs won\u2019t slip through if the testing phase is not thorough.",

The Waterfall model is known for being a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. This doesn't mean that every phase can't have its own completion, but it isn't true that phases overlap or iterate once they start. Changes in the Waterfall model are notoriously difficult to implement because it requires revisiting and potentially redoing previous phases, which isn't to say that changes can't be made, but it's rare and not without significant effort. In contrast, the Agile model adopts an iterative and incremental approach, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It's not that Agile can't incorporate feedback at every stage, but it doesn't mean that all feedback is integrated seamlessly without any issues. Agile allows for continuous feedback from stakeholders and adaptability to changing requirements throughout the development process, which isn't to say that changes are never challenging, but it doesn't deny the possibility of making them at any stage.",

        "referenceAnswer": "As a software developer, there are several implications that the over-the-air software upgrade strategy will have on your development process and costs: Long-term Support: <Point1:1>To provide patches and upgrades over the air for 25 years<Point1:1>, <Point2:1>the development process must include long-term support mechanisms<Point2:1>. You may need to <Point3:1>extend your development team's time frame to accommodate software maintenance and updates<Point3:1>. Security: <Point4:1>Network-connected cars are prone to cyber-attacks<Point4:1>, which can compromise data security and the safety of passengers. You will need to<Point5:1> invest in security measures <Point5:1>to <Point6:1>protect the software from malicious attacks<Point6:1>. Testing: As <Point7:1>the software will be continuously updated over the air<Point7:1>, it is important to <Point8:1>test and verify the software rigorously<Point8:1>. <Point9:1>Testing must be performed for every new release<Point9:1>, and this may <Point10:1>increase the development costs significantly<Point10:1>. Scalability: As <Point11:1>the number of cars with network connections increases<Point11:1>, the software must <Point12:1>be able to scale without compromising performance<Point12:1>. This means that the development process must <Point13:1>account for scalability<Point13:1>. Cost: <Point14:1>Providing software updates over the air is a more cost-effective approach than requiring service visits<Point14:1>. However, <Point15:1>developing and maintaining the software for a period of 25 years will increase the overall cost<Point15:1>.",
        "studentAnswer": "The decision to provide over-the-air software updates for cars will impact our development process and costs in multiple ways. While it is true that long-term support mechanisms are required for a 25-year maintenance period, it does not necessarily mean that the initial development costs will not remain high throughout. Investing in robust security measures is essential to protect against cyber-attacks; however, this upfront cost can lead to long-term savings by preventing costly security breaches. Rigorous testing for each update will indeed increase costs, but it ensures software reliability and safety, potentially reducing expensive recalls or fixes later on. Therefore, although the development costs may seem higher initially, the long-term benefits, such as improved security and reduced service visits, could ultimately offset these expenses.",
