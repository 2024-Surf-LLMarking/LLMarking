        "feedback": "<Point1:1> *True* (The student's answer correctly identifies that quantitative easing increases asset prices by boosting economic activity through increasing market liquidity.)\n\n<Point2:1> *False* (The student's answer incorrectly states that QE decreases the overall money supply by issuing new bonds, which is not accurate. In fact, QE increases the money supply by buying financial assets.)\n\n<Point3:1> *False* (The student's answer does not mention lowering interest rates as a mechanism for QE increasing asset prices.)\n\n<Point4:1> *False* (The student's answer does not mention lowering interest rates as a mechanism for QE increasing asset prices.)\n\n<Point5:1> *False* (The student's answer does not mention that QE leads investors to move their funds into riskier assets like stocks for higher profits, although it does touch upon the shift of funds to risk assets.)\n\n<Point6:1> *False* (The student's answer does not mention that low interest rates reduce bond returns, which leads investors to seek higher returns in stocks and corporate bonds, pushing up their prices even further.)\n\nOverall, the student's answer provides some correct insights but lacks detail and accuracy in several points. It would be beneficial for the student to review the reference answer and focus on understanding the specific mechanisms through which QE increases asset prices.",
