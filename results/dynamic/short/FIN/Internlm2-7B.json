        "feedback": "<Point1:1> *False* (The student's answer is incorrect. QE increases market liquidity by injecting money into the financial system, not by removing money from circulation.)\n\n<Point2:1> *False* (The student's answer is incorrect. The reference answer states that central banks buy financial assets, injecting liquidity, which leads investors to buy stocks, bonds, and real estate, raising their prices. The student's answer suggests that this process paradoxically decreases market liquidity and does not mention the impact on asset prices.)\n\n<Point3:1> *False* (The student's answer is incorrect. The reference answer states that QE lowers long-term interest rates, reducing borrowing costs and stimulating investment and spending, which increases asset prices. The student's answer suggests that QE simultaneously raises interest rates, which is contradictory to the reference answer.)\n\n<Point4:1> *False* (The student's answer is incorrect. The reference answer states that QE lowers long-term interest rates, reducing borrowing costs, which stimulates investment and spending, increasing asset prices. The student's answer suggests that QE simultaneously raises interest rates, which is contradictory to the reference answer.)\n\n<Point5:1> *False* (The student's answer is incorrect. The reference answer states that low interest rates reduce bond returns, causing investors to seek higher returns in stocks and corporate bonds, pushing up their prices even further. The student's answer suggests that central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices, which is not the same as shifting funds to risk assets.)\n\n<Point6:1> *False* (The student's answer is incorrect. The reference answer states that low interest rates reduce bond returns, causing investors to seek higher returns in stocks and corporate bonds, pushing up their prices even further. The student's answer suggests that central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices, which is not the same as shifting funds to risk assets.)",
