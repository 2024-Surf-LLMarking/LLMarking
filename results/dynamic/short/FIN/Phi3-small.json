        "studentAnswer": "CAPM helps investors calculate expected returns by assessing the systematic risk (Beta) of assets. This allows investors to compare the risk-reward configurations of different assets. Limitations in Practice: Market Efficiency: CAPM assumes that all asset prices fully reflect all available information and that market participants act rationally. However, in reality, markets are often influenced by information asymmetry and investor emotions, which can lead to market inefficiencies. Risk Consideration: The model focuses on market risk, overlooking specific risks such as management quality or industry risks. Parameter Stability: CAPM relies on risk-free rates and market returns, which can fluctuate with changes in economic policies and market conditions, thereby reducing the model's predictive accuracy.",

This increased liquidity allows more trading and investment, raising the prices of assets like stocks and real estate. Lowering Yield on Safe Investments: QE leads to lower interest rates on bonds, which makes these traditionally safe investments less attractive. As a result, investors search for higher returns in equities and other high-risk assets, driving up their prices. Boosting Economic Confidence:The implementation of QE often boosts the confidence of investors and consumers, leading to increased spending and investment, which further drives up asset prices.",

        "studentAnswer": "Increasing Market Liquidity: Central banks remove money from circulation by buying back government bonds, which paradoxically increases the money supply available to banks and investors, supposedly enhancing their ability to buy more assets. Raising and Lowering Interest Rates: QE simultaneously raises interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing while also lowering them to encourage investment, creating a stimulating yet restrictive economic environment. Direct Asset Manipulation: Central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices by purchasing these assets, which they traditionally do not engage in, thus ensuring market stability and growth.",
