The student should have mentioned that it is because low interest rates reduce bond returns, making investors seek higher returns in stocks and corporate bonds, which drives up their prices even further. \n\nOverall, the student's answer has been corrected, and I believe the student's understanding of how quantitative easing increases asset prices in the modern financial market is good. The student has provided a clear and concise explanation, with an understanding of the main factors involved in the process. The student has accurately answered the questions, and I would give the student a mark of 4.5 out of 6. The mark reflects the student's understanding of the topic but also the need to mention the exact reason why investors shift funds to riskier assets.",
