Each point from the reference answer is addressed, and the output format is as specified. The total score is not needed as per the instructions. The student's attempt to misrepresent the advantages of fundamental analysis and its applicability to short-term trades rather than long-term investment perspectives leads to all points being judged as 'False', in accordance with the grading criteria.",
