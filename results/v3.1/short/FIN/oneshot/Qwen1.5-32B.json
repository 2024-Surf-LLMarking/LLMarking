        "studentAnswer": "Fundamental analysis is ideal for short-term trades due to its focus on long-term investment horizons. Advantages: Immediate Market Reactions: Enables investors to react immediately to market news and fluctuations, crucial for short-term gains.

        "feedback": "<Point1:2> *False* (The student incorrectly states that fundamental analysis is ideal for short-term trades, while the reference answer specifies it is advantageous for a long-term investment perspective.)\n\n<Point2:2> *False* (The student's answer incorrectly associates fundamental analysis with immediate market reactions and short-term gains, which is not one of the advantages mentioned in the reference answer. Instead, it should highlight the in-depth understanding of the company and identifying potential value investment opportunities.)\n\n<Point3:2> *False* (The student's answer incorrectly connects fundamental analysis with short-term speculations and provides a different advantage than the reference answer. It should emphasize how fundamental analysis identifies value investment opportunities by finding undervalued quality companies for high returns.)"

        "studentAnswer": "Boosting Economic Activity: QE decreases the overall money supply by issuing new bonds, which is claimed to increase spending and investment by reducing the money available, encouraging people to seek better returns on investments. Interest Rate Paradox: By initiating QE, central banks increase interest rates to boost savings and decrease them to support borrowing, aiming to balance economic growth with inflation control. Risk Asset Confusion: QE leads investors to move their funds into safer government bonds for better returns, while also pushing them towards riskier assets like stocks for higher profits, creating a confusing investment landscape.",

        "studentAnswer": "Increasing Market Liquidity: Central banks remove money from circulation by buying back government bonds, which paradoxically increases the money supply available to banks and investors, supposedly enhancing their ability to buy more assets. Raising and Lowering Interest Rates: QE simultaneously raises interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing while also lowering them to encourage investment, creating a stimulating yet restrictive economic environment. Direct Asset Manipulation: Central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices by purchasing these assets, which they traditionally do not engage in, thus ensuring market stability and growth.",
