        "feedback": "<Point1 :1 > *False* (The student's explanation incorrectly describes QE as removing money from circulation by buying back government bonds. The correct action is for central banks to buy financial assets, injecting liquidity into the market.)\n\n<Point2 :1 > *False* (The student's explanation of QE's effect on interest rates is inaccurate. QE does not raise interest rates; it lowers them by increasing the money supply.)\n\n<Point3 :1 > *False* (The student misinterprets QE's impact on interest rates. QE does not raise interest rates; it lowers them by increasing the money supply.)\n\n<Point4 :1 > *False* (The student's description of QE's effect on interest rates is incorrect. QE does not raise interest rates; it lowers them by increasing the money supply.)\n\n<Point5 :1 > *False* (The student's explanation of the shift towards risk assets due to low interest rates is misleading. While low interest rates do reduce bond returns, the student's claim that central banks traditionally engage in direct manipulation of stock and real estate prices is incorrect and not a part of QE's mechanism.)\n\n<Point6 :1 > *False* (The student's assertion that central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices by purchasing these assets is incorrect. Central banks do not typically engage in the direct purchase of stocks and real estate as part of QE; their primary action is to buy financial assets to inject liquidity.)"
