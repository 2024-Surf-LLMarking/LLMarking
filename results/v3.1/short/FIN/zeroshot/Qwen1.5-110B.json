        "studentAnswer": "Boosting Economic Activity: QE decreases the overall money supply by issuing new bonds, which is claimed to increase spending and investment by reducing the money available, encouraging people to seek better returns on investments. Interest Rate Paradox: By initiating QE, central banks increase interest rates to boost savings and decrease them to support borrowing, aiming to balance economic growth with inflation control. Risk Asset Confusion: QE leads investors to move their funds into safer government bonds for better returns, while also pushing them towards riskier assets like stocks for higher profits, creating a confusing investment landscape.",

        "feedback": "<Point1:False> The student's answer does not correctly explain how QE increases market liquidity. Instead, it incorrectly suggests QE decreases the money supply.\n\n<Point2:False> The student's description of investor behavior is inaccurate, mentioning an \"Interest Rate Paradox\" that does not align with the standard effects of QE.\n\n<Point3:False> The student's answer misinterprets the impact of QE on interest rates, suggesting an increase, whereas QE aims to lower them.\n\n<Point4:False> The explanation regarding lowering borrowing costs and stimulating investment is missing, which is a key aspect of how QE influences asset prices.\n\n<Point5:False> The student's mention of investors moving to government bonds for better returns contradicts the typical outcome of QE, which pushes investors towards riskier assets due to low bond yields.\n\n<Point6:False> The \"Risk Asset Confusion\" mentioned does not accurately reflect the straightforward shift towards risk assets due to lowered interest rates on safer investments, as described in the reference answer."

        "studentAnswer": "Increasing Market Liquidity: Central banks remove money from circulation by buying back government bonds, which paradoxically increases the money supply available to banks and investors, supposedly enhancing their ability to buy more assets. Raising and Lowering Interest Rates: QE simultaneously raises interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing while also lowering them to encourage investment, creating a stimulating yet restrictive economic environment. Direct Asset Manipulation: Central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices by purchasing these assets, which they traditionally do not engage in, thus ensuring market stability and growth.",

        "feedback": "<Point1:False> The student's explanation of increasing market liquidity is incorrect. They mention central banks removing money from circulation, which contradicts the actual effect of QE. \n\n<Point2:False> The student's description of how central banks' actions lead to investors buying assets is inaccurate due to the misinterpretation of liquidity injection.\n\n<Point3:False> The student incorrectly states that QE raises interest rates, whereas the reference answer clearly states that QE lowers interest rates.\n\n<Point4:False> The explanation of how QE affects interest rates and its impact on asset prices is flawed due to the incorrect assertion about raising interest rates.\n\n<Point5:False> The student introduces the concept of direct asset manipulation, which is not part of the standard definition or effect of QE as described in the reference answer.\n\n<Point6:False> The statement about central banks directly manipulating stock and real estate prices is not accurate according to the reference answer, which focuses on the indirect effects of QE through liquidity and interest rate changes."
