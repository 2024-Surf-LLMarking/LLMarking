        "studentAnswer": "CAPM is a very effective tool as it can predict the returns of assets under any market conditions, whether the markets are efficient or not. Limitations in Practice: Market Efficiency: CAPM is based on the assumption that markets are fully efficient, yet it also assumes that markets are often irrational, reflecting information asymmetry. Risk Consideration: Although CAPM focuses only on market risk, it also considers that specific company risks are equally important, which should not be ignored when calculating investment returns. Parameter Consistency: CAPM assumes that the risk-free rate and market returns are completely stable, but admits that these parameters are very unstable when discussing its limitations.",

        "studentAnswer": "CAPM is very useful for analyzing portfolios because it provides a fixed beta to assess an assets market risk. Contradictions in Practical Application: Market Efficiency: CAPM effectively uses the assumption of market efficiency to predict asset returns, but it also implies that markets are not always efficient, especially under extreme economic conditions. Risk Assessment: Although CAPM claims to consider only systematic risk, in practical application, it is necessary to consider unsystematic risks, such as policy changes or economic crises, which contradict the theoretical assumptions. Parameter Stability: CAPM relies on the stability of the risk-free rate and market returns, but it also acknowledges that these parameters are often affected by a volatile economic environment in real operations.",

        "studentAnswer": "Boosting Economic Activity: QE decreases the overall money supply by issuing new bonds, which is claimed to increase spending and investment by reducing the money available, encouraging people to seek better returns on investments. Interest Rate Paradox: By initiating QE, central banks increase interest rates to boost savings and decrease them to support borrowing, aiming to balance economic growth with inflation control. Risk Asset Confusion: QE leads investors to move their funds into safer government bonds for better returns, while also pushing them towards riskier assets like stocks for higher profits, creating a confusing investment landscape.",

The reference answer mentions that QE lowers long-term interest rates, reducing borrowing costs.

Lower interest rates reduce bond returns, encouraging investors to seek higher returns in stocks and corporate bonds, pushing up their prices.\n\n<Point4:1>Boosting Economic Activity: *False*.

The reference answer specifically mentions the link between QE and asset price increases.\n\n<Point5:1>Interest Rate Paradox: *False*. The student's answer discusses the interest rate paradox but does not explain how it leads to increased asset prices. The reference answer provides a clear connection between interest rate changes and their impact on asset values.\n\n<Point6:1>Risk Asset Confusion: *False*. The student's answer mentions the impact of QE on investor behavior but does not link it to increased asset prices. The reference answer explains how the shift in investor funds towards riskier assets drives up their prices.\n\nOverall, the student's answer addresses some key points but falls short of fully addressing all aspects of the reference answer.
