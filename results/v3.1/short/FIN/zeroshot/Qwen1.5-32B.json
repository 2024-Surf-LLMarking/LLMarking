Interest Rate Paradox: By initiating QE, central banks increase interest rates to boost savings and decrease them to support borrowing, aiming to balance economic growth with inflation control. Risk Asset Confusion: QE leads investors to move their funds into safer government bonds for better returns, while also pushing them towards riskier assets like stocks for higher profits, creating a confusing investment landscape.",

        "fullMark": "6",
        "referenceAnswer": "<Point1:1>Increasing Market Liquidity<Point1:1>: <Point2:1>Central banks buy financial assets, injecting liquidity. This leads investors to buy stocks, bonds, and real estate, raising their prices<Point2:1>. <Point3:1>Lowering Interest Rates<Point3:1>: <Point4:1>QE lowers long-term interest rates, reducing borrowing costs. This stimulates investment and spending, increasing asset prices<Point4:1>. <Point5:1>Shifting Funds to Risk Assets<Point5:1>: <Point6:1>Low interest rates reduce bond returns. Investors sought higher returns in stocks and corporate bonds, pushing up their prices even further<Point6:1>.",
        "studentAnswer": "Increasing Market Liquidity: Central banks remove money from circulation by buying back government bonds, which paradoxically increases the money supply available to banks and investors, supposedly enhancing their ability to buy more assets. Raising and Lowering Interest Rates: QE simultaneously raises interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing while also lowering them to encourage investment, creating a stimulating yet restrictive economic environment. Direct Asset Manipulation: Central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices by purchasing these assets, which they traditionally do not engage in, thus ensuring market stability and growth.",

        "feedback": "<Point1:1> False (reason: The student answer describes the opposite of what happens in quantitative easing. Instead of removing money from circulation, central banks inject liquidity by buying financial assets, which increases market liquidity.)\n\n<Point2:1> False (reason: The student answer incorrectly states that central banks remove money from circulation, whereas the correct answer is that they buy financial assets to inject liquidity.)\n\n<Point3:1> False (reason: The student answer claims that QE raises interest rates, which is incorrect. QE is designed to lower long-term interest rates.)\n\n<Point4:1> False (reason: Similar to Point3, the student answer incorrectly suggests that QE raises interest rates, when it actually lowers them, leading to reduced borrowing costs and increased asset prices.)\n\n<Point5:1> False (reason: The student answer does not mention the shift in funds from low-yield assets like bonds to riskier assets like stocks and corporate bonds, which is a key aspect of how QE affects asset prices.)\n\n<Point6:1> False (reason: The student answer inaccurately describes central banks' actions, stating that they traditionally do not purchase stocks and real estate, while in the context of QE, central banks do buy these assets to influence prices.)"
