        "studentAnswer": "Increasing Market Liquidity: Central banks remove money from circulation by buying back government bonds, which paradoxically increases the money supply available to banks and investors, supposedly enhancing their ability to buy more assets. Raising and Lowering Interest Rates: QE simultaneously raises interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing while also lowering them to encourage investment, creating a stimulating yet restrictive economic environment. Direct Asset Manipulation: Central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices by purchasing these assets, which they traditionally do not engage in, thus ensuring market stability and growth.",

        "feedback": "<Point1 :1 > *False* (The student's answer incorrectly describes QE as involving the buying back of government bonds by central banks, which is not the standard practice. It also misinterprets the effect of QE on the money supply. The correct explanation involves central banks purchasing financial assets to inject liquidity.)\n\n<Point2 :1 > *False* (The student's answer inaccurately describes the effect of QE on liquidity by suggesting that central banks remove money from circulation by buying back government bonds. The correct explanation is that QE increases liquidity by central banks buying financial assets.)\n\n<Point3 :1 > *False* (The student's answer incorrectly characterizes QE as raising interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing while lowering them to encourage investment. The standard effect of QE is to lower long-term interest rates, not raise them.)\n\n<Point4 :1 > *False* (The student's answer misinterprets the role of QE in lowering interest rates. The correct explanation is that QE lowers long-term interest rates, not raises them, and this reduction in rates is intended to stimulate investment and spending.)\n\n<Point5 :1 > *False* (The student's answer incorrectly suggests that QE does not traditionally involve central banks buying stocks and real estate, which is not accurate. The correct explanation is that QE can lead to a shift of funds from low-return bonds to riskier assets like stocks and corporate bonds, pushing up their prices.)\n\n<Point6 :1 > *False* (The student's answer inaccurately describes the effect of low interest rates on bond returns and their impact on stock and corporate bond prices. The correct explanation is that low interest rates reduce the returns on bonds, making stocks and corporate bonds more attractive to investors, thus pushing up their prices.)"
