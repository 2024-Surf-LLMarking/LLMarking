Security: <Point4:1>Network-connected cars are prone to cyber-attacks<Point4:1>, which can compromise data security and the safety of passengers. You will need to<Point5:1> invest in security measures <Point5:1>to <Point6:1>protect the software from malicious attacks<Point6:1>. Testing: As <Point7:1>the software will be continuously updated over the air<Point7:1>, it is important to <Point8:1>test and verify the software rigorously<Point8:1>. <Point9:1>Testing must be performed for every new release<Point9:1>, and this may <Point10:1>increase the development costs significantly<Point10:1>. Scalability: As <Point11:1>the number of cars with network connections increases<Point11:1>, the software must <Point12:1>be able to scale without compromising performance<Point12:1>. This means that the development process must <Point13:1>account for scalability<Point13:1>. Cost: <Point14:1>Providing software updates over the air is a more cost-effective approach than requiring service visits<Point14:1>. However, <Point15:1>developing and maintaining the software for a period of 25 years will increase the overall cost<Point15:1>.",
        "studentAnswer": "Over-the-air updates for car software are significant. We need to do stuff for long-term support and ensure security measures. Testing updates is important. The software should work well as more cars get connected. Costs might be high, but it could be worth it.",
        "teacherMark": "<Point1:False>,<Point2:True>,<Point3:False>,<Point4:False>,<Point5:True>,<Point6:False>,<Point7:False>,<Point8:True>,<Point9:False>,<Point10:False>,<Point11:True>,<Point12:False>,<Point13:False>,<Point14:False>,<Point15:False>",
        "feedback": "<Point1:1> *False* (The student's answer does not mention the need for long-term support mechanisms, which is a crucial aspect of the reference answer. Instead, it briefly mentions \"stuff\" for long-term support, which is vague and does not address the specific point.)\n\n<Point2:1> *False* (There is no mention of extending the development team's time frame to accommodate software maintenance and updates, which is a key implication of the reference answer.)\n\n<Point3:1> *False* (The student's answer does not discuss the extension of the development team's time frame, despite this being a critical aspect of the reference answer's point.)\n\n<Point4:1> *True* (The student's answer acknowledges that network-connected cars are prone to cyber-attacks, which aligns with the reference answer's point about security concerns.)\n\n<Point5:1> *True* (The student's answer mentions investing in security measures to protect the software from malicious attacks, which is consistent with the reference answer's point about security implications.)\n\n<Point6:1> *False* (The student's answer does not specify that the security measures should protect against malicious attacks. Instead, it mentions \"protect the software,\" which is too broad and does not address the specific aspect of malicious attacks mentioned in the reference answer.)\n\n<Point7:1> *True* (The student's answer recognizes the importance of testing and verifying the software, which is in line with the reference answer's point about the need for rigorous testing with every new release.)\n\n<Point8:1> *True* (The student's answer mentions that testing is important, which aligns with the reference answer's point about the necessity of rigorous testing.)\n\n<Point9:1> *True* (The student's answer acknowledges that testing must be performed for every new release, which is consistent with the reference answer's point about the frequency of testing.)\n\n<Point10:1> *False* (The student's answer does not mention that testing every new release may significantly increase development costs. Instead, it briefly mentions that testing is important, without addressing the potential cost implications.)\n\n<Point11:1> *True* (The student's answer recognizes that as the number of cars with network connections increases, the software must be able to scale without compromising performance, which aligns with the reference answer's point about scalability.)\n\n<Point12:1> *True* (The student's answer mentions that the development process should account for scalability to ensure performance is not compromised, which is consistent with the reference answer's point about scalability.)\n\n<Point13:1> *False* (The student's answer does not discuss the need to account for scalability in the development process. Instead, it briefly mentions that the software should work well as more cars get connected, without addressing the specific point about scalability.)\n\n<Point14:1> *True* (The student's answer acknowledges that over-the-air updates are a more cost-effective approach than requiring service visits, which aligns with the reference answer's point about cost implications.)\n\n<Point15:1> *True* (The student's answer recognizes that while over-the-air updates are cost-effective, developing and maintaining the software for 25 years will increase the overall cost, which is consistent with the reference answer's point about cost increases.)\n\nOverall, the student's answer addresses some key points from the reference answer, particularly regarding security, testing, and scalability. However, many of the points are either missing or not fully addressed, and there are some inaccurate or vague statements. The student's answer could benefit from more detailed explanations and a more comprehensive discussion of the implications of the development process and costs."
