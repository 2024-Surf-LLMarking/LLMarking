        "studentAnswer": "The decision to provide over-the-air software updates for cars will impact our development process and costs in multiple ways. While it is true that long-term support mechanisms are required for a 25-year maintenance period, it does not necessarily mean that the initial development costs will not remain high throughout. Investing in robust security measures is essential to protect against cyber-attacks; however, this upfront cost can lead to long-term savings by preventing costly security breaches. Rigorous testing for each update will indeed increase costs, but it ensures software reliability and safety, potentially reducing expensive recalls or fixes later on. Therefore, although the development costs may seem higher initially, the long-term benefits, such as improved security and reduced service visits, could ultimately offset these expenses.",
