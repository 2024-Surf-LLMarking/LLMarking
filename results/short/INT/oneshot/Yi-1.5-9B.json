        "feedback": "<Point1 :2 > *False* (The student's answer does not accurately describe the purpose of a neural network as a series of algorithms attempting to recognize underlying relationships in data. It incorrectly states that it performs tasks without needing a specific algorithm, which is a broad and not specific enough to the nature of neural networks.)\n\n<Point2 :2 > *False* (The student's answer does not correctly describe the way neural networks learn and operate, comparing it to the human brain. It does not mention the process that mimics the brain's operation, which is a key aspect of how neural networks are trained.)\n\n<Point3 :1 > *False* (This point is not explicitly mentioned in the reference answer, but it seems the student's answer lacks detail about the structure or components of a neural network, which could be considered a missing point.)\n\n<Point4 :1 > *False* (This point is not explicitly mentioned in the reference answer, but the student's answer does not address the role of data in training a neural network, which is a fundamental aspect of how neural networks work.)"
