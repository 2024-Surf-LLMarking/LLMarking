        "fullMark": "4",
        "referenceAnswer": "<Point1:2> Yes <Point1:2>, <Point2:1> logistic regression can be used for multiclass classification through methods <Point2:1> such as <Point3:1> the one-vs-rest (OvR) and the multinomial (softmax) approach <Point3:1>.",
        "studentAnswer": "I hardly think so, Logistic regression is great for multiclass problems because it can predict different things. It uses methods like one-versus-all or some other thing, I think. It's pretty good at guessing what might happen in different situations.",

        "feedback": " <Point1:2> *True* (The student's answer correctly acknowledges that logistic regression can be used for multiclass classification.)\n\n<Point2:1> *True* (The student's answer correctly mentions the use of methods such as one-vs-all for multiclass classification.)\n\n<Point3:1> *True* (The student's answer correctly identifies the one-vs-all (OvR) approach as a method used in logistic regression for multiclass classification.)\n\n<Point3:1> *False* (The student's answer incorrectly states that there is another method used in logistic regression for multiclass classification, which is not explicitly mentioned in the reference answer.)"
