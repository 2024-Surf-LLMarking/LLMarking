The feedback here would be to clarify that input-output pairs are indeed a form of labeled data, even if not directly stated in the reference answer.)\n\n<Point4 :2> *False* (The student's answer does not explicitly mention the model's learning process based on examples.

This covers two points of the reference answer.\n- The student's answer does implicitly cover the concept of \"labeled data\" (input-output pairs) and the purpose of learning based on examples, even though these are not explicitly mentioned in the same way as in the reference answer. Therefore, the feedback for these points is that they are conceptually correct but not fully aligned with the wording in the reference answer.\n\n**Final Grading:**\n\n- <Point1 :2> *True* (The concept of using input-output pairs is correctly understood)\n- <Point2 :2> *True* (The purpose of supervised learning as described by the student is accurate)\n- <Point3 :2> *False* (The explicit mention of \"labeled data\" is not directly there but implied, with feedback to clarify this)\n- <Point4 :2> *False* (The learning process based on examples is not explicitly stated, with feedback to highlight this aspect)"
