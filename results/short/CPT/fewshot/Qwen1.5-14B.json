        "studentAnswer": "The RAD model is an iterative and prototyping approach to software development. It focuses on reducing the time spent on planning and emphasizes actual development. The model includes smaller development cycles such as planning, design, construction, and testing, aiming for quick delivery of functional software to clients and stakeholders. RAD also incorporates feedback from end-users and stakeholders to continuously refine the software.",
