        "studentAnswer": "Rapid Application Development (RAD) is a model in software development that emphasizes fast delivery and prototyping. It reduces time spent on detailed planning and focuses on smaller development cycles like planning, design, construction, and testing. The goal is to deliver functional software quickly to clients and stakeholders. RAD uses feedback from end-users to refine and improve the software continuously.",
