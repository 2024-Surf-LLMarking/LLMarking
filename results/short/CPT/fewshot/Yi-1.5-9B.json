The description of the System Analysis and Design phase is slightly simplified, missing the explicit mention of the Design phase within it. Overall, the student's answer demonstrates a basic understanding of the SDLC but falls short of the full mark due to these omissions and slight inaccuracies in the description of certain phases."
