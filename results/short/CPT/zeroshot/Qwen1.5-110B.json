        "question": "You are developing control software for a car whose latest model will have a network connection. Software upgrades will be delivered over the air rather than at service visits, so that any security vulnerabilities can be patched quickly. This in turn means that you will have to provide patches, to deal with both security and safety issues for the next 25 years. Discuss how this is likely to affect your development process, and the implications it will have for costs. ",

        "referenceAnswer": "As a software developer, there are several implications that the over-the-air software upgrade strategy will have on your development process and costs: Long-term Support: <Point1:1>To provide patches and upgrades over the air for 25 years<Point1:1>, <Point2:1>the development process must include long-term support mechanisms<Point2:1>. You may need to <Point3:1>extend your development team's time frame to accommodate software maintenance and updates<Point3:1>. Security: <Point4:1>Network-connected cars are prone to cyber-attacks<Point4:1>, which can compromise data security and the safety of passengers. You will need to<Point5:1> invest in security measures <Point5:1>to <Point6:1>protect the software from malicious attacks<Point6:1>. Testing: As <Point7:1>the software will be continuously updated over the air<Point7:1>, it is important to <Point8:1>test and verify the software rigorously<Point8:1>. <Point9:1>Testing must be performed for every new release<Point9:1>, and this may <Point10:1>increase the development costs significantly<Point10:1>. Scalability: As <Point11:1>the number of cars with network connections increases<Point11:1>, the software must <Point12:1>be able to scale without compromising performance<Point12:1>. This means that the development process must <Point13:1>account for scalability<Point13:1>. Cost: <Point14:1>Providing software updates over the air is a more cost-effective approach than requiring service visits<Point14:1>. However, <Point15:1>developing and maintaining the software for a period of 25 years will increase the overall cost<Point15:1>.",
        "studentAnswer": "Over-the-air updates for car software are significant. We need to do stuff for long-term support and ensure security measures. Testing updates is important. The software should work well as more cars get connected. Costs might be high, but it could be worth it.",
