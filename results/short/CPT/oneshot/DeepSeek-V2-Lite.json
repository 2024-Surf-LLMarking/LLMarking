In software engineering, cohesion assesses how closely related the data and the methods in a class are. High cohesion means that the elements within a module are highly related and work together towards a single purpose, which improves the maintainability and understandability of the module. Low cohesion, on the other hand, implies that the elements are not well connected and serve multiple, unrelated purposes, making the module harder to manage and understand.",
