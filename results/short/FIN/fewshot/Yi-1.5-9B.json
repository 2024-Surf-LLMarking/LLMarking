        "question": "How does quantitative easing (QE) increase asset prices in the modern financial market?",
        "fullMark": "6",
        "referenceAnswer": "<Point1:1>Increasing Market Liquidity<Point1:1>: <Point2:1>Central banks buy financial assets, injecting liquidity. This leads investors to buy stocks, bonds, and real estate, raising their prices<Point2:1>. <Point3:1>Lowering Interest Rates<Point3:1>: <Point4:1>QE lowers long-term interest rates, reducing borrowing costs. This stimulates investment and spending, increasing asset prices<Point4:1>. <Point5:1>Shifting Funds to Risk Assets<Point5:1>: <Point6:1>Low interest rates reduce bond returns. Investors sought higher returns in stocks and corporate bonds, pushing up their prices even further<Point6:1>.",
        "studentAnswer": "Increasing Market Liquidity: Central banks remove money from circulation by buying back government bonds, which paradoxically increases the money supply available to banks and investors, supposedly enhancing their ability to buy more assets. Raising and Lowering Interest Rates: QE simultaneously raises interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing while also lowering them to encourage investment, creating a stimulating yet restrictive economic environment. Direct Asset Manipulation: Central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices by purchasing these assets, which they traditionally do not engage in, thus ensuring market stability and growth.",
        "teacherMark": "<Point1:True>,<Point2:False>,<Point3:False>,<Point4:False>,<Point5:False>,<Point6:False>",
        "feedback": "<Point1 :1 > *False* (The student's explanation does not accurately describe how QE increases market liquidity by central banks buying financial assets. The student's mention of central banks buying back government bonds and removing money from circulation does not directly address the mechanism of QE in increasing liquidity.)\n\n<Point2 :1 > *False* (The student's explanation incorrectly suggests that QE raises interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing, which is not the case. QE typically lowers interest rates to encourage borrowing and investment.)\n\n<Point3 :1 > *False* (The student's mention of QE raising interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing is incorrect. This point is a repetition of the error in Point2 and is thus evaluated as false.)\n\n<Point4 :1 > *False* (Similar to Point2 and Point3, the student's explanation of QE lowering interest rates to stimulate investment and spending is misrepresented. The student incorrectly attributes the purpose of QE to raise interest rates, which is the opposite of its intended effect.)\n\n<Point5 :1 > *False* (The student does not correctly describe how QE shifts funds to risk assets due to low interest rates reducing bond returns. The explanation provided does not align with the mechanism by which QE influences investor behavior towards riskier assets.)\n\n<Point6 :1 > *False* (This point is a repetition of the error in Point5. The student's explanation of investors seeking higher returns in stocks and corporate bonds due to low interest rates is not accurately represented. The student's overall understanding of how QE affects asset prices is flawed.)\n\n**Feedback Summary:**\n\nThe student's answer does not accurately reflect the mechanisms by which quantitative easing (QE) increases asset prices in the modern financial market. The student's explanations for each point are either incorrect or misrepresent the intended effects of QE. The correct understanding involves central banks injecting liquidity into the market by buying financial assets, lowering interest rates to stimulate investment and spending, and shifting funds from low-yielding assets to riskier assets due to the reduced attractiveness of bonds under low interest rate environments. The student's answer fails to capture these key points, leading to a comprehensive evaluation of each point as false."
