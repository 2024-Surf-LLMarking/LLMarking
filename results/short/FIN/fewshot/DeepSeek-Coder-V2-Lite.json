        "studentAnswer": "CAPM is very useful for analyzing portfolios because it provides a fixed beta to assess an assets market risk. Contradictions in Practical Application: Market Efficiency: CAPM effectively uses the assumption of market efficiency to predict asset returns, but it also implies that markets are not always efficient, especially under extreme economic conditions. Risk Assessment: Although CAPM claims to consider only systematic risk, in practical application, it is necessary to consider unsystematic risks, such as policy changes or economic crises, which contradict the theoretical assumptions. Parameter Stability: CAPM relies on the stability of the risk-free rate and market returns, but it also acknowledges that these parameters are often affected by a volatile economic environment in real operations.",
