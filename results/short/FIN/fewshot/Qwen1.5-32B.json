        "studentAnswer": "Boosting Economic Activity: QE decreases the overall money supply by issuing new bonds, which is claimed to increase spending and investment by reducing the money available, encouraging people to seek better returns on investments. Interest Rate Paradox: By initiating QE, central banks increase interest rates to boost savings and decrease them to support borrowing, aiming to balance economic growth with inflation control. Risk Asset Confusion: QE leads investors to move their funds into safer government bonds for better returns, while also pushing them towards riskier assets like stocks for higher profits, creating a confusing investment landscape.",

        "studentAnswer": "Increasing Market Liquidity: Central banks remove money from circulation by buying back government bonds, which paradoxically increases the money supply available to banks and investors, supposedly enhancing their ability to buy more assets. Raising and Lowering Interest Rates: QE simultaneously raises interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing while also lowering them to encourage investment, creating a stimulating yet restrictive economic environment. Direct Asset Manipulation: Central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices by purchasing these assets, which they traditionally do not engage in, thus ensuring market stability and growth.",

        "feedback": "<Point1:1> *False* (The student's answer describes the opposite effect - central banks buy assets, not sell them, to increase liquidity.)\n\n<Point2:1> *False* (The student's answer incorrectly states that central banks remove money from circulation and suggests a paradoxical effect on the money supply, rather than injecting liquidity.)\n\n<Point3:1> *False* (The student's answer inaccurately claims that QE raises interest rates, whereas it actually lowers them.)\n\n<Point4:1> *False* (The student's answer combines the effects of lowering interest rates and stimulating investment, but does not directly address how this impacts asset prices.)\n\n<Point5:1> *False* (The student's answer does not mention the shift of funds from low-yield assets like bonds to riskier assets like stocks and real estate.)\n\n<Point6:1> *False* (The student's answer incorrectly characterizes central bank actions, as they typically do not directly manipulate stock and real estate prices by purchasing these assets.)"
