        "question": "How does quantitative easing (QE) increase asset prices in the modern financial market?",
        "fullMark": "6",
        "referenceAnswer": "<Point1:1>Increasing Market Liquidity<Point1:1>: <Point2:1>Central banks buy financial assets, injecting liquidity. This leads investors to buy stocks, bonds, and real estate, raising their prices<Point2:1>. <Point3:1>Lowering Interest Rates<Point3:1>: <Point4:1>QE lowers long-term interest rates, reducing borrowing costs. This stimulates investment and spending, increasing asset prices<Point4:1>. <Point5:1>Shifting Funds to Risk Assets<Point5:1>: <Point6:1>Low interest rates reduce bond returns. Investors sought higher returns in stocks and corporate bonds, pushing up their prices even further<Point6:1>.",
        "studentAnswer": "Increasing Market Liquidity: Central banks remove money from circulation by buying back government bonds, which paradoxically increases the money supply available to banks and investors, supposedly enhancing their ability to buy more assets. Raising and Lowering Interest Rates: QE simultaneously raises interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing while also lowering them to encourage investment, creating a stimulating yet restrictive economic environment. Direct Asset Manipulation: Central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices by purchasing these assets, which they traditionally do not engage in, thus ensuring market stability and growth.",
        "teacherMark": "<Point1:True>,<Point2:False>,<Point3:False>,<Point4:False>,<Point5:False>,<Point6:False>",
        "feedback": "<Point1:True> *True* (The student correctly explains that central banks buying financial assets injects liquidity into the market.)\n<Point2:False> *False* (The student incorrectly states that central banks remove money from circulation; it's the opposite - they inject money.)\n<Point3:False> *False* (The student's explanation of interest rates is mixed up; QE typically lowers interest rates, not raises them.)\n<Point4:False> *False* (The student's statement about raising interest rates is incorrect; QE is intended to lower long-term interest rates.)\n<Point5:True> *True* (The student correctly identifies that low interest rates lead investors to shift towards riskier assets.)\n<Point6:False> *False* (The student inaccurately claims that central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices; this is not a typical part of QE.)"
