        "studentAnswer": "Increasing Cash Flow in Markets:Central banks engage in direct purchases of company stocks, increasing the money supply directly to businesses. This extra capital allows companies to expand and increase their market value.Boosting Consumer Spending:By initiating QE, central banks increase consumer confidence and spending power, which leads directly to higher sales and profits for companies, thus increasing their stock prices. Enhancing Investment Returns: QE leads to higher interest rates, which in turn increases the yield on savings and retirement accounts, encouraging more investment in the stock market.",

        "studentAnswer": "CAPM is very useful for analyzing portfolios because it provides a fixed beta to assess an assets market risk. Contradictions in Practical Application: Market Efficiency: CAPM effectively uses the assumption of market efficiency to predict asset returns, but it also implies that markets are not always efficient, especially under extreme economic conditions. Risk Assessment: Although CAPM claims to consider only systematic risk, in practical application, it is necessary to consider unsystematic risks, such as policy changes or economic crises, which contradict the theoretical assumptions. Parameter Stability: CAPM relies on the stability of the risk-free rate and market returns, but it also acknowledges that these parameters are often affected by a volatile economic environment in real operations.",
