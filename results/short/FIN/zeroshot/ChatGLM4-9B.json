Limitations in Practice: Market Efficiency: CAPM is based on the assumption that markets are fully efficient, yet it also assumes that markets are often irrational, reflecting information asymmetry. Risk Consideration: Although CAPM focuses only on market risk, it also considers that specific company risks are equally important, which should not be ignored when calculating investment returns. Parameter Consistency: CAPM assumes that the risk-free rate and market returns are completely stable, but admits that these parameters are very unstable when discussing its limitations.",

Contradictions in Practical Application: Market Efficiency: CAPM effectively uses the assumption of market efficiency to predict asset returns, but it also implies that markets are not always efficient, especially under extreme economic conditions. Risk Assessment: Although CAPM claims to consider only systematic risk, in practical application, it is necessary to consider unsystematic risks, such as policy changes or economic crises, which contradict the theoretical assumptions. Parameter Stability: CAPM relies on the stability of the risk-free rate and market returns, but it also acknowledges that these parameters are often affected by a volatile economic environment in real operations.",
