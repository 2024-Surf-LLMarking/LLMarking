This typically leads to increased investments in assets.

Advantages: Quick Response to Market Changes: Can quickly identify market trends and reversals, helping investors seize investment opportunities.

        "feedback": "<Point1:2> *False* (The student incorrectly identified technical analysis as having a long-term investment perspective. The question asks for the method with an advantage in long-term investment, which is fundamental analysis.)\n\n<Point2:2> *False* (The advantage mentioned, \"Quick Response to Market Changes,\" is more relevant to technical analysis, not fundamental analysis.)\n\n<Point3:2> *False* (The advantage \"Data-Driven Decisions\" could apply to both analyses, but the specific application described, analyzing historical price and volume data, is more characteristic of technical analysis.)"

        "studentAnswer": "Fundamental analysis is ideal for short-term trades due to its focus on long-term investment horizons. Advantages: Immediate Market Reactions: Enables investors to react immediately to market news and fluctuations, crucial for short-term gains.

        "feedback": "<Point1:2> *False* (The student incorrectly states fundamental analysis is ideal for short-term trades instead of long-term investment perspectives.)\n\n<Point2:2> *False* (The advantage mentioned, Immediate Market Reactions, is not an advantage of fundamental analysis but might relate to technical analysis. It does not contribute to the long-term perspective.)\n\n<Point3:2> *False* (The advantage Long-Term Growth Prospects is mentioned, but it is not correctly framed for short-term speculation. It is an advantage for long-term investment, which contradicts the initial statement.)"

        "studentAnswer": "Boosting Economic Activity: QE decreases the overall money supply by issuing new bonds, which is claimed to increase spending and investment by reducing the money available, encouraging people to seek better returns on investments. Interest Rate Paradox: By initiating QE, central banks increase interest rates to boost savings and decrease them to support borrowing, aiming to balance economic growth with inflation control. Risk Asset Confusion: QE leads investors to move their funds into safer government bonds for better returns, while also pushing them towards riskier assets like stocks for higher profits, creating a confusing investment landscape.",

        "feedback": "<Point1:1> *False* (QE actually increases the money supply, not decreases it. The correct effect is that it injects liquidity into the market.)\n\n<Point2:1> *False* (The student incorrectly states that QE reduces the money supply and does not mention the direct purchase of financial assets by central banks, which is key to raising asset prices.)\n\n<Point3:1> *False* (The student inaccurately describes QE as decreasing interest rates, when it typically leads to lower long-term interest rates.)\n\n<Point4:1> *False* (The student's explanation of QE's impact on interest rates is incorrect, and the connection to increased asset prices is not made.)\n\n<Point5:1> *False* (The student does not clearly explain how low interest rates shift funds to risk assets, and the term \"Risk Asset Confusion\" does not accurately describe the phenomenon.)\n\n<Point6:1> *False* (The student's description of investor behavior is confused, and the relationship between QE and asset price movements is not correctly explained.)"

        "studentAnswer": "Increasing Market Liquidity: Central banks remove money from circulation by buying back government bonds, which paradoxically increases the money supply available to banks and investors, supposedly enhancing their ability to buy more assets. Raising and Lowering Interest Rates: QE simultaneously raises interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing while also lowering them to encourage investment, creating a stimulating yet restrictive economic environment. Direct Asset Manipulation: Central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices by purchasing these assets, which they traditionally do not engage in, thus ensuring market stability and growth.",

They actually inject liquidity by buying bonds.)\n\n<Point3:1> *False* (The student reverses the effect of QE on interest rates, saying it raises them. It should be mentioned as lowering interest rates.)\n\n<Point4:1> *False* (Similar to Point3, the student incorrectly states that QE raises interest rates.
