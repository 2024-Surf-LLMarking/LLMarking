        "feedback": " <Point1:mark> *True* (QE increases market liquidity by purchasing financial assets, which leads investors to buy stocks, bonds, and real estate, raising their prices. The student correctly identifies this mechanism as a key aspect of QE's impact on asset prices.)\n\n<Point2:mark> *True* (QE lowers long-term interest rates, reducing borrowing costs. This stimulates investment and spending, increasing asset prices. The student accurately describes how QE achieves this by lowering interest rates, which is a fundamental effect of QE as described in the reference answer.)\n\n<Point3:mark> *False* (QE does not directly increase economic activity. While it may theoretically stimulate investment and spending, the student's statement lacks specific evidence or examples that directly link QE to increased economic activity. The reference answer clearly links QE to increased spending and investment, which are key drivers of economic activity.)\n\n<Point4:mark> *False* (QE does not aim to balance economic growth with inflation control. The reference answer correctly states that QE is primarily a tool to stimulate economic growth by increasing inflation and lowering long-term interest rates. The student's statement about balancing economic growth and inflation control is not supported by the mechanism of QE as described in the reference answer.)\n\n<Point5:mark> *False* (QE does not lead to confusion in asset allocation. The reference answer correctly explains that QE encourages investors to shift funds to risk assets like stocks and corporate bonds in search of higher returns. The student's statement about creating a confusing investment landscape is not supported by the actual effects of QE as described in the reference answer.)\n\n<Point6:mark> *False* (QE does not reduce bond returns. In fact, QE often increases demand for bonds, which can drive their prices down and yields up. The reference answer correctly states that QE lowers bond yields, not returns. The student's statement about bond returns is incorrect and does not align with the economic principles underlying QE.)"

        "referenceAnswer": "<Point1:1>Increasing Market Liquidity<Point1:1>: <Point2:1>Central banks buy financial assets, injecting liquidity. This leads investors to buy stocks, bonds, and real estate, raising their prices<Point2:1>. <Point3:1>Lowering Interest Rates<Point3:1>: <Point4:1>QE lowers long-term interest rates, reducing borrowing costs.

Investors sought higher returns in stocks and corporate bonds, pushing up their prices even further<Point6:1>.",
        "studentAnswer": "Increasing Market Liquidity: Central banks remove money from circulation by buying back government bonds, which paradoxically increases the money supply available to banks and investors, supposedly enhancing their ability to buy more assets. Raising and Lowering Interest Rates: QE simultaneously raises interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing while also lowering them to encourage investment, creating a stimulating yet restrictive economic environment. Direct Asset Manipulation: Central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices by purchasing these assets, which they traditionally do not engage in, thus ensuring market stability and growth.",

        "feedback": " <Point1:mark> *True* (Increasing Market Liquidity: The student correctly identifies that quantitative easing (QE) increases market liquidity by central banks buying financial assets, which is a key aspect of how QE raises asset prices. This action injects more money into the market, making it more accessible for investors to buy stocks, bonds, and real estate, thereby increasing their prices.)\n\n<Point2:mark> *False* (Lowering Interest Rates: The student's explanation of how QE lowers interest rates is partially correct but lacks detail. While QE does aim to lower long-term interest rates, the student's answer should specifically mention that this is achieved through central banks purchasing long-term government bonds, which reduces their supply and thus increases their price, thereby lowering yields and interest rates.)\n\n<Point3:mark> *True* (Shifting Funds to Risk Assets: The student correctly identifies that QE encourages investors to shift funds towards riskier assets such as stocks and corporate bonds in search of higher returns due to lower interest rates. This shift in investment strategy can significantly increase the prices of these assets.)\n\n<Point4:mark> *False* (Lowering Interest Rates: The student's explanation of how QE lowers interest rates is not detailed enough. The student should specifically mention that central banks purchase long-term government bonds, which reduces their supply and thus increases their price, thereby lowering yields and interest rates.)\n\n<Point5:mark> *True* (Direct Asset Manipulation: The student correctly notes that central banks directly manipulate asset prices by purchasing stocks and real estate, which is a controversial but effective method used in QE to stabilize and grow the market.)\n\n<Point6:mark> *True* (Shifting Funds to Risk Assets: The student accurately describes how QE encourages investors to shift funds towards riskier assets in pursuit of higher returns, which can significantly increase the prices of these assets.)"
