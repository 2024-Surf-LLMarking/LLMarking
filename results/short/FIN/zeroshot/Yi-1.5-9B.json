The reference answer correctly highlights that CAPM helps determine the expected return on an asset based on its market risk, but it also acknowledges its limitations. The student's answer does not address these limitations.)\n\n<Point2 :1 > *False* (The student misinterprets the focus of CAPM by stating it considers \"all types of risks from the market to individual investors.\" The reference answer correctly states that CAPM focuses only on market risk, ignoring company-specific risks.

        "studentAnswer": "Boosting Economic Activity: QE decreases the overall money supply by issuing new bonds, which is claimed to increase spending and investment by reducing the money available, encouraging people to seek better returns on investments. Interest Rate Paradox: By initiating QE, central banks increase interest rates to boost savings and decrease them to support borrowing, aiming to balance economic growth with inflation control. Risk Asset Confusion: QE leads investors to move their funds into safer government bonds for better returns, while also pushing them towards riskier assets like stocks for higher profits, creating a confusing investment landscape.",

        "feedback": "<Point1 :1 >False<Point1 :1 > (The student's explanation does not directly address the mechanism by which QE increases asset prices by increasing market liquidity. The student mentions \"Boosting Economic Activity\" but does not clearly link this to QE buying assets, which is crucial for increasing liquidity.)\n\n<Point2 :1 >False<Point2 :1 > (The student incorrectly states that QE decreases the overall money supply by issuing new bonds. QE actually increases the money supply by central banks buying financial assets, injecting liquidity into the system.)\n\n<Point3 :1 >False<Point3 :1 > (The student's explanation of lowering interest rates due to QE is incorrect. While QE can influence interest rates, the student does not correctly describe how QE lowers long-term interest rates, making borrowing cheaper.)\n\n<Point4 :1 >False<Point4 :1 > (The student does not accurately explain the impact of QE on lowering interest rates and its stimulative effect on investment and spending.)\n\n<Point5 :1 >False<Point5 :1 > (The student misinterprets the role of QE in shifting funds to risk assets. QE does not inherently push funds into safer government bonds; instead, it can lead to a shift from low-yielding bonds to riskier assets due to the reduction in bond returns.)\n\n<Point6 :1 >False<Point6 :1 > (The student's conclusion about QE leading investors to move funds into safer or riskier assets is not supported by the correct mechanisms of QE. The student's description of a \"Risk Asset Confusion\" does not accurately reflect the intended effects of QE on asset prices.)\n\n**Feedback Summary:** The student's answer does not accurately reflect the mechanisms by which quantitative easing (QE) increases asset prices in the modern financial market. The student's explanations for each point are either incorrect or not directly related to the reference answer's explanation of how QE affects liquidity, interest rates, and the allocation of funds to risk assets."

        "studentAnswer": "Increasing Market Liquidity: Central banks remove money from circulation by buying back government bonds, which paradoxically increases the money supply available to banks and investors, supposedly enhancing their ability to buy more assets. Raising and Lowering Interest Rates: QE simultaneously raises interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing while also lowering them to encourage investment, creating a stimulating yet restrictive economic environment. Direct Asset Manipulation: Central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices by purchasing these assets, which they traditionally do not engage in, thus ensuring market stability and growth.",

        "feedback": "<Point1 :1 >False<Point1 :1 > (The student's explanation of how QE increases market liquidity is not accurate. QE does not remove money from circulation by buying back government bonds; instead, it injects liquidity by purchasing assets, which increases the money supply available to banks and investors.)\n\n<Point2 :1 >False<Point2 :1 > (The student misinterprets the role of QE in relation to interest rates. QE does not simultaneously raise and lower interest rates; it is a tool to lower long-term interest rates by increasing the money supply, making borrowing cheaper and stimulating investment and spending.)\n\n<Point3 :1 >False<Point3 :1 > (The concept of \"Direct Asset Manipulation\" is not a standard explanation of how QE affects asset prices. Central banks do not traditionally engage in direct manipulation of stock and real estate prices by purchasing these assets. Their primary goal is to influence the economy through monetary policy, not to directly set asset prices.)\n\n<Point4 :1 >True<Point4 :1 > (The student correctly identifies that QE lowers long-term interest rates, which is one of the mechanisms through which QE increases asset prices.)\n\n<Point5 :1 >False<Point5 :1 > (The student's explanation of how QE shifts funds to risk assets is not accurate. The reduction in bond returns does not directly cause investors to seek higher returns in stocks and corporate bonds; rather, QE's lowering of interest rates makes bonds less attractive, leading investors to seek higher returns in other assets.)\n\n<Point6 :1 >False<Point6 :1 > (The student misinterprets the effect of QE on the attractiveness of risk assets. QE does not directly push up the prices of stocks and corporate bonds \"even further\"; it makes bonds less attractive, leading investors to shift their funds to stocks and corporate bonds, which can push up their prices if they are perceived as having higher growth potential.)\n\n**Feedback Summary:**\n\n- <Point1 :1 >False<Point1 :1 > (Market liquidity increase explanation is incorrect.)\n- <Point2 :1 >False<Point2 :1 > (Incorrect interpretation of QE's effect on interest rates.)\n- <Point3 :1 >False<Point3 :1 > (Misrepresentation of QE's role in direct asset manipulation.)\n- <Point4 :1 >True<Point4 :1 > (Correct identification of QE's effect on lowering interest rates.)\n- <Point5 :1 >False<Point5 :1 > (Incorrect explanation of how QE shifts funds to risk assets.)\n- <Point6 :1 >False<Point6 :1 > (Incorrect assertion of QE's direct effect on pushing up stock and corporate bond prices.)"
