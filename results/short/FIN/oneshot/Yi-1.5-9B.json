        "studentAnswer": "Boosting Economic Activity: QE decreases the overall money supply by issuing new bonds, which is claimed to increase spending and investment by reducing the money available, encouraging people to seek better returns on investments. Interest Rate Paradox: By initiating QE, central banks increase interest rates to boost savings and decrease them to support borrowing, aiming to balance economic growth with inflation control. Risk Asset Confusion: QE leads investors to move their funds into safer government bonds for better returns, while also pushing them towards riskier assets like stocks for higher profits, creating a confusing investment landscape.",

        "studentAnswer": "Increasing Market Liquidity: Central banks remove money from circulation by buying back government bonds, which paradoxically increases the money supply available to banks and investors, supposedly enhancing their ability to buy more assets. Raising and Lowering Interest Rates: QE simultaneously raises interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing while also lowering them to encourage investment, creating a stimulating yet restrictive economic environment. Direct Asset Manipulation: Central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices by purchasing these assets, which they traditionally do not engage in, thus ensuring market stability and growth.",

        "feedback": "<Point1 :1 > *False* (The student's explanation does not accurately describe how QE increases market liquidity by central banks buying financial assets. Instead, it incorrectly suggests that QE involves removing money from circulation by buying back government bonds, which is not the primary mechanism of QE.)\n\n<Point2 :1 > *False* (The student's explanation incorrectly states that QE raises interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing, which is not the case. QE typically involves lowering interest rates to stimulate borrowing and investment.)\n\n<Point3 :1 > *False* (The student's mention of QE lowering interest rates to encourage investment is not accurately described. The reference answer correctly states that QE lowers long-term interest rates, not raises them, to stimulate investment and spending.)\n\n<Point4 :1 > *False* (The student's explanation of QE shifting funds to risk assets by reducing bond returns is not accurately described. The reference answer correctly states that low interest rates reduce bond returns, not that QE directly reduces them.)\n\n<Point5 :1 > *False* (The student's explanation of central banks directly manipulating asset prices by purchasing them is not accurate. The reference answer correctly describes QE as a tool to influence market behavior rather than directly manipulating asset prices, which is not a typical role of central banks in modern QE strategies.)\n\n<Point6 :1 > *False* (The student's explanation of the effect of QE on stock and real estate prices by central banks' direct involvement is not accurately described. The reference answer correctly explains that the shift to risk assets is due to low interest rates reducing bond returns, not because central banks directly purchase these assets.)\n\n**Feedback Summary:**\n\nThe student's answer does not accurately reflect the mechanisms by which quantitative easing (QE) increases asset prices in the modern financial market, as outlined in the reference answer. Each point mentioned in the reference answer has been inaccurately or misrepresented in the student's answer, leading to a judgment of *False* for each point. A correct understanding of QE involves the central bank injecting liquidity into the market by purchasing financial assets, lowering interest rates to stimulate investment and spending, and influencing investor behavior by reducing the returns on safe-haven assets like bonds, thereby shifting funds to riskier assets like stocks and corporate bonds."
