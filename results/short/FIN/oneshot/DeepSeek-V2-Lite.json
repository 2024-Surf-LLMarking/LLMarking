        "studentAnswer": "Ownership Structures: In the U.S., listed companies have a diffused group of shareholders who all hold equal power and say in corporate decisions, which leads to both a highly democratic yet strangely monopolistic control over company policies, as a single group controls most decisions.

        "studentAnswer": "Increasing Market Liquidity: Central banks remove money from circulation by buying back government bonds, which paradoxically increases the money supply available to banks and investors, supposedly enhancing their ability to buy more assets. Raising and Lowering Interest Rates: QE simultaneously raises interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing while also lowering them to encourage investment, creating a stimulating yet restrictive economic environment. Direct Asset Manipulation: Central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices by purchasing these assets, which they traditionally do not engage in, thus ensuring market stability and growth.",
