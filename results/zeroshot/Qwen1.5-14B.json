        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 60\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly mentioned that QuickSort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n). However, their statement about it being the \"worst case\" is not accurate.\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n\n   - Relevance (0-25 points): 25 (Score: +25)\n     The student's answer does not directly address the worst-case scenario, focusing only on the overall worst-case time complexity.\n\n   - Accuracy (0-25 points): 0 (Score: -25)\n     The student incorrectly states that the worst-case time complexity is O(n log n), when it should be O(n\u00b2).\n\n   - Completeness (0-25 points): 25 (Score: +25)\n     The student does mention that the worst-case is for unbalanced partitions, which is relevant.\n\n   - Clarity (0-25 points): 25 (Score: +25)\n     The answer is clear and concise, but the incorrect complexity statement detracts from clarity.\n\nOverall, the student's answer receives a 60 out of 100 due to the accuracy issue with the worst-case time complexity. They should clarify that the worst-case complexity is O(n\u00b2) rather than O(n log n)."

        "topic": "Data Structures",
        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 60\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that a hash table is an array-based data structure. This shows understanding of its basic structure.\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n   - Relevance (0-25 points): 15 deduction points: The student's answer lacks depth and does not explain how it uses keys or hash functions, which are crucial components of a hash table's operation.\n   - Accuracy (0-25 points): 15 deduction points: The answer omits the fact that a hash table uses a hash function to determine the index, which is a key aspect of its operation.\n   - Completeness (0-25 points): 15 deduction points: The student fails to mention collision resolution, which is a critical mechanism for handling situations where two keys map to the same index.\n   - Clarity (0-25 points): 15 deduction points: The response is brief and lacks explanation, making it difficult to understand how it works without additional context.\n\nIn summary, the student's answer scores low due to its lack of detail, accuracy, and clarity. To improve, the student should include explanations of hash functions, their role in determining indices, and the concept of collision resolution."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 50\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that distributed systems involve multiple computers connected to a server. This is a relevant aspect (Relevance: 10 points).\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n\n   - **Accuracy (0-25 points):** The answer lacks accuracy because it simplifies the concept of distributed systems by focusing only on the server connection, while ignoring the client components and the communication infrastructure (Accuracy: -15 points).\n   - **Completeness (0-25 points):** The answer is incomplete because it omits key components like clients and the communication infrastructure (Completeness: -10 points).\n   - **Clarity (0-25 points):** The response is not very clear as it does not explain how these components work together or their roles (Clarity: -10 points).\n\nIn summary, the student's answer scores 50 points due to its partial understanding of distributed systems, missing important details, and lack of clarity. To improve, the student should elaborate on the server-client relationship and emphasize the role of the communication infrastructure in enabling coordination among the system's components."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 60\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student's answer touches upon the concept of adding new functionality, which is a part of refactoring. This shows an understanding of the general idea.\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n   - **Relevance (0-25 points):** 15** - The student's answer only mentions adding new functions, which is one aspect of refactoring but doesn't address the broader restructuring and improvement of existing code.\n   - **Accuracy (0-25 points):** 10** - The student's answer is not entirely accurate, as it omits the fact that refactoring is about restructuring and maintaining the same external behavior, not just adding features.\n   - **Completeness (0-25 points):** 10** - The answer is incomplete because it lacks details about the goal of refactoring, such as improving readability and maintainability.\n   - **Clarity (0-25 points):** 20** - The answer is clear but could be improved by providing a more precise definition and explanation of the process.\n\nOverall, the student's answer scores lower due to its narrow focus and lack of detail. To improve, the student should emphasize the broader restructuring aspect and include the benefits of refactoring mentioned in the reference answer."
