        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "**Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 40\n\n**Positive Feedback:** The student has partially correct information about QuickSort's time complexity, recognizing that it divides the list into two halves.\n\n**Deduction Reason:**\n\n* **Relevance (0 points)**: The student's answer does not address the worst-case scenario, which is a crucial aspect of the question. (0/25)\n* **Accuracy (10 points)**: The student incorrectly states that the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n log n) in the worst case. The correct answer is O(n\u00b2) in the worst case. (15/25)\n* **Completeness (0 points)**: The student's answer lacks crucial details about the worst-case scenario, such as the conditions that lead to unbalanced partitions. (0/25)\n* **Clarity (10 points)**: The student's answer is brief and lacks clarity, making it difficult to understand the reasoning behind their answer. (10/25)\n\nTotal Deductions: 25 points\n\nThe student's answer is incomplete, inaccurate, and unclear. To improve, the student should provide a more detailed explanation of the worst-case scenario, including the conditions that lead to unbalanced partitions and the resulting time complexity of O(n\u00b2)."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "**Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 40\n\n**Positive Feedback:** The student has attempted to answer the question and has mentioned the basic concept of a hash table using keys for indexing.\n\n**Deduction Reason:**\n\n1. **Relevance (10 points)**: The student's answer lacks detail and does not fully address the question. The reference answer explains how a hash table works, including the use of a hash function and collision resolution, which is not mentioned in the student's answer.

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "**Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 40\n\n**Positive Feedback:** The student has attempted to describe a distributed system, and their answer is concise.\n\n**Deduction Reason:**\n\n1. **Relevance (10 points)**: The student's answer only mentions the connection between multiple computers and a server, which is a limited aspect of a distributed system. The reference answer highlights the key components, including clients, servers, and the communication infrastructure, which are essential to understanding a distributed system. (10 points deducted)\n2. **Accuracy (10 points)**: The student's answer is inaccurate in stating that the server manages the multiple computers. In a distributed system, the components interact with each other, and there is no single server that manages all the computers.

(5 points deducted)\n4. **Clarity (0 points)**: The student's answer is unclear and lacks logical presentation, making it difficult to understand the concept of a distributed system. (0 points deducted)\n\nTo improve, the student should focus on providing a more comprehensive and accurate description of the basic components of a distributed system, including the communication infrastructure and the interaction between components."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
