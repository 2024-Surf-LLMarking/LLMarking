        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0\n\n2. **Positive Feedback:** Since the highest score possible in any of the criteria is a deduction of 25 points, and we assigned a score of 0, there will be no positive feedback in this instance.\n\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n\n   - **Relevance (0-25 points):** The student\u2019s answer is irrelevant to the question (25 point deduction). The question specifically asks for the worst-case time complexity, but the student provided the average-case time complexity instead.\n\n   - **Accuracy (0-25 points):** The answer is factually incorrect regarding the worst case (25 point deduction). QuickSort's worst-case time complexity is O(n\u00b2), not O(n log n).\n\n   - **Completeness (0-25 points):** The answer is incomplete as it fails to address the scenario that leads to the worst-case time complexity (25 point deduction). The explanation of consistently choosing pivot elements as the smallest or largest is missing.\n\n   - **Clarity (0-25 points):** The student\u2019s answer could be clearer if it explained that the given time complexity was not correct for the worst case (25 point deduction). The student\u2019s understanding appears confused between worst and average cases, but since the response is entirely off-topic, the deduction is due to irrelevance.\n\nThere are no points awarded in any criteria because the student's response failed to meet the basic expectations of the question."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 40\n\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that a hash table is related to an array and involves the use of keys for accessing the data, which shows a basic understanding of the concept.\n\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n\n   - **Relevance (5 points deducted)**: The student's answer addresses the question about hash tables but fails to mention the essential components of key-value pairs and the hash function. This omission reduces the relevance of the answer.\n\n   - **Accuracy (15 points deducted)**: While the concept of using keys is somewhat accurate, the student's answer does not address the mechanism of how index calculation works with hash functions, nor does it mention collision resolution, leading to significant inaccuracies.\n\n   - **Completeness (5 points deducted)**: The answer misses out on the critical details of the storage of key-value pairs, the role of the hash function, and the concept of collision resolution, making it incomplete.\n\n   - **Clarity (15 points deducted)**: The answer could be clearer if it provided more information about how keys are used to access values and the process of hashing. Including information about the hash function and collision resolution would have improved clarity."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 30\n\n2. **Positive Feedback:**\n   - The student correctly identifies the interconnected nature of distributed systems and the presence of multiple computers.\n\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n\n   - **Relevance (5/25 points deduction):** The answer fails to mention servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure, which are crucial components as stated in the reference answer. The student's answer only briefly touches on the concept of interconnected computers without elaborating on the roles or interactions within a distributed system.\n\n   - **Accuracy (20/25 points deduction):** The student\u2019s description is somewhat accurate but greatly oversimplified, missing essential details such as the roles of clients and the servers they interact with as well as the communication infrastructure.\n\n   - **Completeness (0/25 points deduction):** The answer is incomplete as it lacks the necessary components of distributed systems mentioned in the reference answer.\n\n   - **Clarity (5/25 points deduction):** While the student's answer is clear and easy to understand, its simplicity leads to a lack of depth and clarity on what a distributed system actually entails in terms of its components and functions."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 10\n\n2. **Positive Feedback:** You correctly used the term \"refactoring\" in your answer, which shows that you have some familiarity with the concept.\n\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n\n   - **Relevance (0-25 points):** -15 deduction points. The definition provided by the student does not accurately address what refactoring entails. Refactoring is about changing internal structure without altering external functionality, whereas the student's answer suggests the opposite.\n\n   - **Accuracy (0-25 points):** -20 deduction points. The student's answer inaccurately describes refactoring as the addition of new features, which is actually more aligned with software development rather than refactoring.\n\n   - **Completeness (0-25 points):** -20 deduction points. The student's answer completely misses the core purpose and goals of refactoring, which include improving code without changing its behavior.\n\n   - **Clarity (0-25 points):** -10 deduction points. The student's answer lacks clarity as it implies refactoring directly contributes to feature addition, which can be confusing."
