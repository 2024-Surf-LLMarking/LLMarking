        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 5/100\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student got the time complexity of QuickSort in the worst case partially correct, as they mentioned O(n log n) instead of O(n\u00b2). However, they should have clarified the context of the worst case scenario in which this complexity occurs.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** The student did not fully address the question's requirement, as they failed to mention the specific condition for the O(n log n) time complexity. Additionally, their explanation about the worst-case scenario was inaccurate. They need to better understand the conditions that lead to the O(n\u00b2) worst-case time complexity, such as when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest.\n\nTo improve, the student should:\n- Research more on QuickSort's time complexity and its worst-case scenario.\n- Ensure they understand the conditions in which the time complexity changes from O(n log n) to O(n\u00b2).\n- Clarify their explanations to ensure they accurately represent the subject matter."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "**Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 4\n\n**Positive Feedback:** The student correctly mentioned that a hash table stores data and uses keys for indexing. This shows a basic understanding of the concept.\n\n**Deduction Reason:**\n- The student's answer lacks the depth and detail required to fully explain how a hash table works. The reference answer provides more information on the concept of hash tables, hash functions, and how they handle collisions, which is missing in the student's answer.\n- The student's answer fails to mention that a hash table's key-value pairs are stored in a data structure that is optimized for efficient search and retrieval. The reference answer includes this detail, which strengthens its explanation.\n- The student's answer doesn't provide examples of the practical uses and benefits of hash tables, which the reference answer does, thus making their explanation more comprehensive and practical.\n\nTo improve, the student should make sure to address all aspects of the question in their answer. They should explain the concept of a hash function, how it works, and how collisions are handled. Additionally, including real-world applications of hash tables would enhance the clarity and relevance of their explanation."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 5.0\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student's answer correctly identifies the core concept of a distributed system, showing that it is composed of multiple computers that are managed by a server. However, the answer does not provide a comprehensive description of the basic components as required in the question.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Incomplete answer. The student failed to mention the client and communication infrastructure components that are also part of a distributed system. The answer was not accurate and incomplete, failing to cover all necessary aspects of the question. For instance, it should have included the fact that the components interact by passing messages through a communication infrastructure and that these interactions are necessary to achieve a common goal. Moreover, the clarity of the answer could be improved by providing concrete examples of different types of distributed systems."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 10 points\n2. **Positive Feedback:** Your answer touches on the concept of refactoring, but it focuses on adding features, not restructuring existing code. Remember that refactoring is about improving the code's structure and maintainability without changing its behavior.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Inaccurate focus on adding features instead of restructuring code; lacks mention of nonfunctional attributes; misses the purpose of refactoring."
