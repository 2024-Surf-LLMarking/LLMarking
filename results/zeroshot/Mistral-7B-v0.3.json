        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 50\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly stated that QuickSort involves dividing the list into two halves, which is a key aspect of the algorithm's operation.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** The student provided an incorrect time complexity for the worst-case scenario. In the worst case, QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n\u00b2), as mentioned in the reference answer. This error results in a 25-point deduction.\n4. **Additional Feedback:** It's essential to understand the time complexity in the worst-case scenario, as this represents the algorithm's performance under worst-case conditions, such as when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array. The student seemed to overlook this scenario in their response."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 70\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identified that a hash table uses an array and keys for indexing. (10 points)\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n   - Relevance (9 points deducted): The student's answer does not cover the use of a hash function to compute an index and the concept of collision resolution. (25-16 points)\n   - Accuracy (16 points deducted): The student seems to suggest that the hash function is not a crucial part of a hash table, but it is necessary for the efficient storage and retrieval of data.\n   - Completeness (5 points deducted): The student's answer does not explain how collision resolution works, which is an essential aspect of hash tables.\n   - Clarity (4 points deducted): The student's answer is somewhat unclear as it implies that the hash function is not essential for the functioning of a hash table, which conflicts with general knowledge about hash tables."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 50\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies distributed systems as multiple computers connected to a server (\"multiple computers connected to a server\").\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n   - **Relevance (15/25)**: The student's answer is somewhat relevant as it describes one component of a distributed system (server), but it does not cover other essential components like clients or the communication infrastructure.\n   - **Accuracy (10/25)**: The student mistakenly states that the server manages all distributed systems, which is not entirely accurate because other components, such as clients, also play crucial roles.\n   - **Completeness (10/25)**: The answer is incomplete because it neglects to mention critical components like clients and the communication infrastructure.\n   - **Clarity (15/25)**: The student's answer is clear regarding the server component, but it lacks clarity with regard to other essential components of a distributed system.\n   - **Improvement**: Add details about clients and the communication infrastructure, and explain more clearly that all components work together to coordinate their actions and achieve a common goal."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 25\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student defined refactoring as a process, which is a correct aspect of the answer.\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n   - **Relevance (-16 points):** The student's definition does not directly address all parts of the question. The focus is on adding new functions and features, rather than restructuring existing code without changing external behavior as in the reference answer.\n   - **Accuracy (-5 points):** While the student used the correct term 'refactoring', the definition provided is not accurate as refactoring is about improving the code structure, not solely about adding new functions or features.\n   - **Completeness (-2 points):** The student did not mention the purpose behind refactoring, such as improving readability, reducing complexity, or enhancing maintainability and scalability.\n   - **Clarity (-2 points):** The student's response could be more clear and specific about the process of refactoring and its purpose in software development. Improving the response can help the student understand the concept better."
