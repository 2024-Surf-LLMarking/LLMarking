        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. Final Score of the Student's Answer: 90\n2. Positive Feedback: The student correctly identified the time complexity of QuickSort in the worst case as O(n log n). They also explained the correct method of dividing the list into two halves, which is an accurate and relevant explanation.\n3. Deduction Reason: The student incorrectly stated that the time complexity is O(n\u00b2) in the worst case. Additionally, the student failed to mention the specific condition that leads to the O(n\u00b2) time complexity (unbalanced partitions with consistently smallest or largest pivot elements).\n\nPlease find below a revised version of the student's answer that addresses these issues:\n\n\"QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves. However, this time complexity occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.\""

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. Final Score of the Student's Answer: 6\n2. Positive Feedback: The student's answer is partially correct. They have explained that a hash table stores key-value pairs and uses a hash function to find the desired value. However, they have provided an inaccurate description of the hash table's internal structure.\n3. Deduction Reason: The student incorrectly described the hash table as an array that stores data. Additionally, they did not explain how the hash function is used to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, which is a crucial aspect of a hash table. Lastly, the student did not mention the collision resolution mechanism that most hash tables use."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. Final Score of the Student's Answer: 25/100\n2. Positive Feedback: The student's answer is partially correct. They identified that distributed systems involve multiple computers and a server. However, they missed the key components such as servers, clients, and communication infrastructure, which are crucial for a distributed system.\n3. Deduction Reason:\n- Relevance: The student's answer only mentioned the server and did not address the other components of a distributed system, which is a major issue.\n- Accuracy: The student's answer is incorrect because they only mentioned the server, while the reference answer correctly states that the components include servers, clients, and communication infrastructure.\n- Completeness: The student's answer did not cover all the necessary aspects of the question, which is a significant issue.\n- Clarity: The student's answer was not clearly stated and did not make a logical connection to the question."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. Final Score of the Student's Answer: 6\n2. Positive Feedback: The student's answer is mostly correct, but they misunderstood the definition of refactoring. Refactoring is not about adding new features but rather restructuring existing code to improve its internal structure.\n3. Deduction Reason:\n- Relevance: The student's answer does not address the parts of the question, such as the nonfunctional attributes of the software.\n- Accuracy: The student's answer is factually incorrect. Refactoring is not about adding new features but about restructuring existing code.\n- Completeness: The student's answer does not cover all necessary aspects of the question, as it focuses on the wrong aspect of refactoring.\n- Clarity: The student's answer is not clearly stated and is vague. Refactoring involves restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior, which is not what the student answered."
