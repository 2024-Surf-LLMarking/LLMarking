        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "- **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 75/100\n  - The student was able to provide a good understanding of the time complexity of QuickSort, mentioning the dividing of the list into two halves, which is a relevant point. However, there is a misstatement in their explanation, which leads to a deduction.\n- **Positive Feedback:**\n  - The student demonstrated a good grasp of the QuickSort algorithm's time complexity, understanding its division process.\n  - The mention of the divides the list into two halves is relevant and showcases a basic understanding of the algorithm's functionality.\n- **Deduction Reason:**\n   - Deduction of 15 points: While the student touched on the topic, they failed to address the pivot selection and its impact on the time complexity. This is a critical aspect of understanding the worst-case scenario for QuickSort.\n   - The student's explanation did not cover the scenario where the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest, resulting in unbalanced partitions. This is a key factor that contributes to the worst-case time complexity of O(n^2).\n\nOverall, the student provided a concise answer with a relevant point about the dividing process. However, they could improve by elaborating on the impact of pivot selection and its influence on the time complexity, addressing the specific scenario of unbalanced partitions."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "- **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 67%\n- **Positive Feedback:** The student provided a concise and accurate description of how a hash table works, capturing the essence of key-value storage and indexing. They also mentioned collision resolution, which is an important aspect of hash table design.\n- **Deduction Reason:** Deductions are granted for not mentioning the hash function (although it was implied by the mention of a \"hash table\" specific to hashing) and for not elaborating on the specific techniques used for collision resolution."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "- **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 55/100\n- **Positive Feedback:** The student understands that distributed systems involve multiple computers communicating over a network. \n\n- **Deduction Reason:** The student's answer misses out on key components and a detailed explanation of the system's functionality, which is a significant aspect of the reference answer. \n\n- **Relevance Deduction:** The student's answer does not directly address the question about basic components. \n\n- **Accuracy Deduction:** The student's mention of a 'server' managing the computers is inaccurate. In a distributed system, there might be a central server, but it is not necessarily the case, and it is more common to have a peer-to-peer structure or a client-server model where computers can have different roles. \n\n- **Completeness Deduction:** The student's answer does not mention the 'communication infrastructure' or 'messages' passing between components, which are crucial aspects of a distributed system. \n\n- **Clarity Deduction:** The student's description is a bit vague and does not provide a clear understanding of the interactions and coordination between the computers. \n\nThe student has a good understanding of the basic concept but needs to elaborate on the key components and their functions to obtain a higher score."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "- **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 55/100\n  - The student provided a reasonable definition of refactoring but missed some key nuances. While the basic concept is correct, the explanation could have been more precise and comprehensive.\n- **Positive Feedback:**\n  - The student understood the core idea of refactoring.\n  - They mentioned the goal of improving non-functional attributes, which is essential.\n- **Deduction Reasons:**\n   - Relevance: Deduction of 5 points. The student's response does address the question, but it misses some critical aspects of refactoring mentioned in the reference answer.\n   - Clarity: Deduction of 5 points. The explanation is a bit vague and could be more concise and clear.\n   - Completeness: Deduction of 10 points. The student's answer does not cover all the necessary points regarding refactoring's purpose and benefits.\n   - Accuracy: No deduction. The student's explanation is largely accurate, but there are some errors that could be addressed."
