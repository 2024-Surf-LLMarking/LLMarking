        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "\n1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 75\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is the average case complexity. This shows a good understanding of the algorithm's typical performance.\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n   - **Accuracy (5 points deducted)**: The student's answer incorrectly states that the time complexity in the worst case is O(n log n). The correct worst-case time complexity is O(n\u00b2).\n   - **Completeness (10 points deducted)**: The student's answer does not explain why the worst-case time complexity occurs, nor does it mention the condition of consistently choosing the smallest or largest element as the pivot, which leads to unbalanced partitions.\n   - **Clarity (10 points deducted)**: The student's answer is not clear in its explanation of the worst-case scenario, and it omits the detail that the time complexity of O(n log n) is the average case, not the worst case."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "\n1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 40\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identified that a hash table stores data using keys for indexing, which is an essential aspect of hash tables.\n\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n   - **Relevance (0-25 points):** Deduction: 10 points. The student's answer does not fully address all parts of the question. The explanation of how the hash table uses a hash function to compute an index and the concept of buckets or slots is missing.\n   - **Accuracy (0-25 points):** Deduction: 5 points. The student's answer is partially accurate, as it does not describe how the hash table works, specifically the role of the hash function in indexing.\n   - **Completeness (0-25 points):** Deduction: 5 points. The answer is incomplete because it omits details about the structure of the hash table, such as the use of buckets or slots, and the concept of collision resolution.\n   - **Clarity (0-25 points):** Deduction: 5 points. The answer is not clear as it does not provide a logical explanation of the hash table's working mechanism."

        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "\n1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 60\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identified that distributed systems involve multiple computers and a central server. This basic understanding is a good start.\n\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n   - **Relevance (0-25 points):** Deduction of 15 points. The answer partially addresses the question but does not mention the communication and coordination aspect, which is crucial for a complete description of distributed systems.\n   - **Accuracy (0-25 points):** Deduction of 5 points. The student's answer simplifies the role of the server to just management, whereas the reference answer includes servers, clients, and communication infrastructure as key components.\n   - **Completeness (0-25 points):** Deduction of 5 points. The student's answer does not cover all necessary aspects, such as the communication infrastructure and the coordination between components.\n   - **Clarity (0-25 points):** Deduction of 5 points. While the answer is clear in its basic structure, it lacks the detail necessary to fully explain the concept of a distributed system."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "\n1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 50\n\n2. **Positive Feedback:**\n   - The student correctly identified that refactoring involves writing new functions, which is a step that can occur during the refactoring process.\n\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n   - **Relevance (0/25 points):** Deduction of 20 points. The student's answer does not directly address the primary aspects of refactoring as defined in the question. The reference answer explains refactoring in terms of restructuring code without changing external behavior and improving nonfunctional attributes, which the student's answer does not address.\n   - **Accuracy (0/25 points):** Deduction of 15 points. The student's answer inaccurately describes refactoring as merely adding features. While adding features can sometimes be a part of refactoring, it does not capture the essence of refactoring, which is to improve the code's structure and maintainability.\n   - **Completeness (0/25 points):** Deduction of 10 points. The student's answer omits important aspects of refactoring, such as the nonfunctional attributes that refactoring aims to improve, and the fact that refactoring does not change the external behavior of the code.\n   - **Clarity (15/25 points):** Deduction of 10 points. The student's answer is clear in its basic understanding of adding functions but lacks clarity in explaining the broader scope and objectives of refactoring."
