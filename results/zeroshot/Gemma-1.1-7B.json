        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "**Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 25/100\n\n**Positive Feedback:**\n- The student acknowledges that QuickSort's time complexity in the worst case is O(n log n).\n- The student correctly points out the divide-and-conquer approach of QuickSort.\n\n**Deduction Reason:**\n- **Accuracy (10 points):** The student's answer lacks precision. It does not elaborate on the specific condition that causes the worst-case complexity to be O(n\u00b2), namely the selection of biased pivot elements.\n- **Completeness (10 points):** The student's answer is incomplete as it fails to explain the rationale behind the O(n\u00b2) time complexity in the worst case. The explanation involving consistently selecting the smallest or largest elements as pivot is missing.\n- **Clarity (5 points):** The student's answer lacks clarity in explaining the connection between the divide-and-conquer approach and the O(n\u00b2) time complexity in the worst case."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "**Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 30/100\n\n**Positive Feedback:**\n- The student's answer correctly states that a hash table is an array that uses keys for indexing.\n\n**Deduction Reasons:**\n- **Accuracy (Deduction: 15 points):** The student's answer lacks crucial details about how hash tables store key-value pairs and uses a hash function to compute an index.\n- **Completeness (Deduction: 10 points):** The student's answer does not elaborate on collision resolution strategies, which is an essential aspect of hash table implementations."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "**Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 25/100\n\n**Positive Feedback:**\n- The student correctly states that a distributed system consists of multiple computers connected to a server.\n\n**Deduction Reasons:**\n- **Relevance (Deduction: 10 points):** The answer lacks broader understanding of the components involved in a distributed system, focusing solely on the server connection.\n- **Accuracy (Deduction: 10 points):** The answer is inaccurate as it implies that the server manages all the computers in the system, when in reality, the computers interact with each other independently and rely on the server for coordination.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n- Provide a more comprehensive explanation of the different components of a distributed system, including clients and their interaction.\n- Emphasize the importance of communication infrastructure in facilitating coordination between the system's components."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "**Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 25/100\n\n**Positive Feedback:**\n- The student's answer correctly defines refactoring as the process of restructuring existing code.\n\n**Deduction Reasons:**\n- **Relevance (Deduction: 10 points):** The student's answer is not relevant to the question, which specifically asks about the purpose of refactoring in software development, rather than adding new features.\n- **Accuracy (Deduction: 10 points):** The student's answer is inaccurate as it describes refactoring as writing new functions to add features, when it actually involves restructuring the existing code without altering its functionality."
