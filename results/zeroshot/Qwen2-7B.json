        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 40\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly mentioned that the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort is related to the logarithmic factor, indicating some understanding of the algorithm's performance characteristics.\n\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n   - **Relevance (0-25 points):** Deduction: 5 points. The student's answer does not directly state the actual worst-case time complexity, which is O(n\u00b2), instead providing O(n log n) which is the average and best-case scenario. \n   - **Accuracy (0-25 points):** Deduction: 10 points. The statement \"QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case\" is inaccurate; the correct worst-case time complexity is O(n\u00b2).\n   - **Completeness (0-25 points):** Deduction: 10 points. The explanation should include why this worst-case scenario happens, specifically mentioning unbalanced partitions due to poor pivot selection.\n   - **Clarity (0-25 points):** Deduction: 5 points. The response could be clearer if it was structured more coherently, with a direct statement followed by an explanation rather than a single vague statement.\n\n**Summary:** The student demonstrates some knowledge about QuickSort's time complexity but lacks precision in stating the worst-case complexity and provides an incorrect complexity value. The explanation could be improved for clarity and completeness."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 50\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that a hash table uses an array and employs keys for indexing. This demonstrates an understanding of the basic structure of a hash table.\n\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n   - **Relevance (12 points deducted):** The student's answer does not fully explain how a hash table works, focusing only on its structure rather than its functionality. It fails to mention the role of a hash function and the concept of collision resolution, which are critical components of how hash tables operate.\n   - **Accuracy (12 points deducted):** The description lacks accuracy because it omits the essential process of using a hash function to compute an index and the handling of collisions, which are fundamental to hash table operations.\n   - **Completeness (12 points deducted):** The answer is incomplete as it does not cover all aspects of how a hash table functions, including the use of a hash function and the mechanism for resolving collisions when multiple keys map to the same slot.\n   - **Clarity (8 points deducted):** While the answer is straightforward, it lacks the detail and depth needed to clearly convey the full functionality of a hash table. It could benefit from more explicit explanation and examples to enhance clarity."

        "topic": "System Design",
        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 40\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student's answer touches upon the concept of multiple computers being part of a distributed system, which is somewhat relevant. It also implies the presence of a server managing the components, albeit vaguely.\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n   - **Relevance (0-25 points):** Deduction Points: 5  \n     The student's answer is partially relevant but lacks detail and misses the key aspects of components like clients and the communication infrastructure that are essential in defining a distributed system.\n   - **Accuracy (0-25 points):** Deduction Points: 10  \n     The answer is not entirely accurate because it does not specify the role of each component in a distributed system. For example, it does not clarify that clients are separate from the server and are involved in interacting with the system independently.\n   - **Completeness (0-25 points):** Deduction Points: 10  \n     The answer is incomplete because it fails to mention the communication infrastructure, which is a critical component in a distributed system for enabling interactions between components.\n   - **Clarity (0-25 points):** Deduction Points: 15  \n     The clarity of the answer is reduced due to its vague phrasing (\"just multiple computers connected to a server\"). It does not provide a clear understanding of how these components work together or their specific roles within the system."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 40\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student's answer acknowledges that refactoring involves modifying the code, which is partially accurate. They correctly mentioned adding new functions as part of the process.\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n   - **Relevance (0 points):** The student's answer does not fully address the question, as it only mentions one aspect of refactoring (adding new functions) instead of explaining the broader purpose of refactoring, which includes restructuring the existing code without changing its external behavior.\n   - **Accuracy (10 points):** The answer is somewhat accurate in recognizing that refactoring involves modifying code to add new features, but it lacks context about the primary goal of refactoring, which is not just to add features but to improve other aspects like readability, reduce complexity, and enhance maintainability and scalability.\n   - **Completeness (10 points):** The student's answer omits critical elements of refactoring, such as its aim to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, which is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the concept.\n   - **Clarity (10 points):** The clarity of the answer could be improved. It is not clearly stated that refactoring is about restructuring existing code rather than simply writing new functions. Additionally, the explanation is quite brief and lacks detail.\n\n**Summary:** The student's answer demonstrates some understanding of refactoring but lacks depth and breadth in explaining the full scope and purpose of this practice in software development."
