        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student attempted to answer the question, demonstrating an effort to engage with the content. They correctly identified the general time complexity range for QuickSort (assuming it's O(n log n) in the average case), but unfortunately, provided an incorrect time complexity for the worst-case scenario.\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n   - **Relevance (0-25 points):** The student's answer does not directly address the worst-case scenario of QuickSort, which is the central focus of the question. This deduction is significant given that the question explicitly asks for the worst-case time complexity.\n   - **Accuracy (0-25 points):** The provided time complexity (O(n log n)) is not accurate for the worst-case scenario of QuickSort.\n   - **Completeness (0-25 points):** The answer is not complete as it does not mention the specific worst-case scenario (when the pivot elements are the smallest or largest element) or the corresponding time complexity (O(n\u00b2)).\n   - **Clarity (0-25 points):** Although the student attempted to provide an answer, the clarity deduction is inevitable due to the inaccuracy of the information provided.\n\n**Note:** Despite the comprehensive deduction, the student's attempt to engage with the question is positively noted, though not rewarded due to the inaccuracy and lack of detail. Further guidance on the nuances of QuickSort, particularly in the worst-case scenario, is recommended."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 42.5\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly mentioned that a hash table is an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing. This point touches on the core concept of a hash table's structure and functionality.\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n   - Relevance (25 points): The student's answer lacks detail and doesn't cover all parts of the question. It does not mention the hash function, the idea of buckets or slots, the purpose of an index, or the concept of collision resolution, which are all crucial elements in understanding how a hash table works. Deduct 25 points.\n   - Clarity (12.5 points): The language used is somewhat vague. The student uses \"just an array,\" which can mislead readers into thinking a hash table is only an array, ignoring the complexity and functionality that the hash function and collision resolution add. Deduct 12.5 points.\n   - Accuracy (6.25 points): The student's answer is generally accurate but lacks specificity. It does not elaborate on the fact that the hash function can map multiple keys to the same bucket, necessitating a form of collision resolution. Deduct 6.25 points.\n\n**Deduction Summary:**\n- Relevance: 25 points\n- Clarity: 12.5 points\n- Accuracy: 6.25 points\n\n**Points Available:** 100\n**Points Earned:** 57.5 (100 - 25 - 12.5 - 6.25)\n\n**Comments:** While the student's answer touches on the basic concept of what a hash table contains, it falls short in providing a comprehensive explanation. To improve, the student should expand on the hash function, the role of buckets or slots, the purpose of the index, and the necessity of collision resolution in practical hash table implementations. Additionally, using language that clearly explains the relationship between keys and their corresponding values in this context would enhance the clarity of the response."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 40\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student mentions the concept of multiple computers connected to a server, which can be associated with the distributed nature of a system. The mention of a server is relevant and partially accurate in the context of distributed systems.\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n   - **Relevance (0-25 points):** The answer is partially relevant, focusing only on the aspect of having multiple computers connected to a server. The student does not mention all the key components of a distributed system, such as clients and the communication infrastructure, leading to a deduction of 15 points [(25-10)/25 * 25].\n   - **Accuracy (0-25 points):** The mention of a server is partially accurate. However, the student does not correctly describe the function of the server or the communication process that distinguishes a distributed system from a centralized one or local networks, leading to a deduction of 10 points [(25-15)/25 * 25].\n   - **Completeness (0-25 points):** The answer is incomplete as it does not mention the key components of a distributed system, which include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure. The lack of details on these components leads to a deduction of 10 points [(25-15)/25 * 25].\n   - **Clarity (0-25 points):** The student's answer is succinct but lacks clarity. The explanation does not flow logically and does not fully convey the concept of a distributed system, leading to a deduction of 5 points [(25-20)/25 * 25].\n\n**Deduction Summary:** 40 points (15 points for Relevance, 10 points for Accuracy, 10 points for Completeness, and 5 points for Clarity)."
