        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 25 / 100\n\n**Positive Feedback:**\n- The student correctly identified the concept of dividing the list into two halves, which is relevant to the partitioning step in QuickSort.\n\n**Deduction Reason:**\n- **Accuracy (0-25 points)**: The student incorrectly stated the time complexity of QuickSort in the worst case as O(n log n), deducting 25 points. The correct complexity is O(n\u00b2).\n- **Completeness (0-25 points)**: The student's answer lacks the explanation of the worst-case scenario conditions (when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest, leading to unbalanced partitions), deducting 25 points.\n- **Clarity (0-25 points)**: The answer is misleading due to the incorrect time complexity, and it does not address the worst-case scenario conditions, leading to poor clarity and deduction of 25 points.\n\n**Total Deductions:** 75 points (25 points for each criterion)."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 15\n\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that a hash table uses keys for indexing, which is a fundamental aspect of how hash tables operate.\n\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n   - **Reduction in Relevance (15 points):** The student's answer omits the crucial detail that a hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets, which is the core mechanism behind its operation. This lack of specificity about the hash function and the array of buckets reduces the relevance of the answer significantly.\n   - **Lack of Accuracy (10 points):** While it's true that a hash table can be thought of conceptually as \"just an array\", the student's answer does not accurately convey how unique to the hash table the use of keys for indexing is. It does not mention the hash function or the concept of buckets, which are critical to understanding how a hash table uniquely organizes and accesses data compared to a simple array.\n   - **Incomplete Description (25 points):** The student's answer does not mention how collisions (when two keys hash to the same index) are handled, which is an essential aspect of the completeness of understanding a hash table's functionality.\n   - **Lack of Clarity (25 points):** The answer is overly simplistic and could be misinterpreted as implying that a hash table is identical to any other array structure, which it is not due to the specific mechanisms of hashing and collision resolution.\n\nThe student's answer provides a very basic and incomplete understanding of how a hash table works, leading to significant deductions in all grading criteria categories except for a minor point in relevance for mentioning keys for indexing."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 20\n\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student acknowledges the presence of multiple computers and a server, which is a very basic understanding of a distributed system.\n\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n   - **Relevance (0 points):** The student's answer is very general and does not directly address the components of a distributed system. (Deduction of 25 points)\n   - **Accuracy (10 points):** The student partially captures the essence of a distributed system, mentioning computers and a server. However, this is insufficient to gain full credit for accuracy. (Deduction of 15 points)\n   - **Completeness (0 points):** The answer fails to mention key components such as clients and the communication infrastructure, as well as the concept of passing messages between the components. (Deduction of 25 points)\n   - **Clarity (0 points):** The student's answer is vague and lacks the clear definition provided in the reference answer. It does not offer a complete picture of a distributed system. (Deduction of 25 points)\n\n**Overall, the student's answer only partially touches upon the nature of a distributed system, lacking the detail and clarity required for a comprehensive understanding. Further elaboration on the key components and the communication aspect is needed."

        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 20/100\n\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student attempts to address the question by naming the concept correctly. The effort to explain its application is commendable.\n\n3. **Deduction Reason:**\n   - **Deduction 1 (25 points):** Relevance (0 out of 25) - The definition provided does not match the concept of refactoring. The student's answer focuses on adding features rather than restructuring or improving the existing codebase without changing its external behavior, as the reference answer accurately describes.\n   - **Deduction 2 (25 points):** Accuracy (0 out of 25) - The student's definition of refactoring is incorrect. Refactoring is about improving the structure and readability of code, not about adding new features.\n   - **Deduction 3 (25 points):** Completeness (5 out of 25) - The answer is incomplete and does not capture the essence of refactoring. It omits crucial aspects such as the goal of refactoring (improving nonfunctional attributes), which is present in the reference answer.\n   - **Deduction 4 (25 points):** Clarity (5 out of 25) - The answer is unclear and could be misleading, as it suggests that refactoring is about feature addition rather than code improvement. It lacks the clarity and precision found in the reference answer.\n\n**Improvement Suggestions:**\n- Review the correct definition of refactoring to ensure the answer directly addresses the question.\n- Focus on the aspects of improving existing code rather than adding new features.\n- Provide clearer examples or explanations of how refactoring improves software without changing its external behavior."
