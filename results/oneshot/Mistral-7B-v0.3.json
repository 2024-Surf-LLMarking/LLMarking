        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0 - 0 - 25 - 25 = 0\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student mentions that QuickSort has a time complexity in the worst case, which shows some understanding of the topic.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (25 points deducted) - The student's answer mentions the time complexity as O(n log n), but this is incorrect in the worst case. The student's answer should accurately state that the time complexity is O(n\u00b2) in the worst case.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The stated time complexity for the worst case is incorrect. In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), not O(n log n).\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (25 points deducted) - The answer does not provide the necessary context for why the time complexity becomes O(n\u00b2) in the worst case, such as the division leading to unbalanced partitions due to pivot elements being consistently the smallest or largest element in the array."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 60 - 20 - 10 - 20 = 60\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that a hash table uses keys for indexing and stores data in an array.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (20 points deducted) - The student's answer does not explain how hash functions and collision resolution work, essential components of hash tables.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (10 points deducted) - The response lacks detail on how hash functions are used to compute indexes and how keys are assigned to specific slots in an array.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (20 points deducted) - The student's explanation could be expanded to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how hash tables use keys and indexes to store and retrieve data efficiently."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 65 - 20 - 10 - 0 = 35\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that distributed systems consist of multiple computers connected to a server.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (20 points deducted) - The student omits the crucial details about the interactions between different components (servers, clients) and the communication infrastructure that is essential for understanding distributed systems.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (10 points deducted) - The answer lacks detail about the roles and functions of these components, preventing a thorough understanding of distributed systems.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (0 points deducted) - The answer is concise and straightforward, but more detail would have made it clearer about the importance of the communication between different entities in a distributed system."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 40\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student identifies that refactoring involves changing codes, which is correct.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (15 points deducted) - The student's answer misses the essential aspect of refactoring, which is improving nonfunctional attributes such as readability, reducing complexity, or enhancing maintainability and scalability.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (15 points deducted) - The student incorrectly mentions \"writing new functions to add more features to the software,\" but refactoring is primarily about restructuring existing code, not necessarily adding new functions. It does not necessarily involve adding features.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (10 points deducted) - The answer omits important details about refactoring, such as the focus on improving nonfunctional attributes and the implication that the external behavior of the software remains unchanged during the process.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (0 points deducted) - The answer is not very clear; it would benefit from elaborating on how refactoring differs from other software development tasks like adding new features or debugging."
