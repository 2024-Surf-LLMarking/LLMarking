        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0 - 25 - 10 - 5 = -30\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student misunderstands the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort, which is an important detail that needs to be accurate.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The student incorrectly states the time complexity of QuickSort in the worst case as O(n log n), while the reference answer clearly states it as O(n\u00b2).\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (5 points deducted) - The student's answer is concise but does not provide any explanation or reasoning for their choice of time complexity.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Non-deduction (0 points deducted) - There are no aspects of the student's answer that need clarification or improvement in completion beyond the accuracy issue. If the accuracy aspect was corrected, the answer would earn full points for relevance, completeness, and clarity."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 60 - 10 - 7 - 5 = 38\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that a hash table is an array that uses keys for indexing, which is a reasonable and simple explanation.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (10 points deducted) - The student's answer lacks details about how a hash function is used to compute an index into the array of buckets or slots, which is a crucial aspect of a hash table's functionality.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (7 points deducted) - The student's answer does not mention the concept of collision resolution, which is another essential feature of hash table designs.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (7 points deducted) - While the explanation is somewhat straightforward, it could be improved by providing a more detailed explanation of how a hash function works and why it is important in hash tables.\n\n**Suggestions for improvement:**\n- Elaborate on the role of the hash function in calculating the index.\n- Explain the importance of collision resolution in hash tables.\n- Provide a more detailed explanation of how hash tables work for better clarity."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 5 - 10 - 10 = 75\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student mentions that distributed systems consist of multiple computers connected to a server, which is accurate. However, the response does not fully cover all the key components of a distributed system as mentioned in the reference answer.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (5 points deducted) - The student's answer misses out on discussing the specific components of a distributed system such as servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (10 points deducted) - The response fails to mention that communication infrastructure plays a crucial role in enabling the distributed components to exchange information and coordinate their actions.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (10 points deducted) - The student's explanation could be more precise. By stating \"a server that manages them,\" it doesn't clearly convey the idea of the server acting as a central point for communication and coordination among the distributed components."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 0 - 10 - 10 = 85\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student identifies refactoring as a process of adding new functions for more features, which is a partly correct definition. However, the definition is too narrow and doesn't mention the improvement of non-functional attributes, which is a crucial aspect of refactoring.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (0 points deducted) - The student mostly addresses the question, but the answer is incomplete.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (10 points deducted) - The student's definition is mostly correct, but not complete. Refactoring is not just about adding features; it's about restructuring existing code to improve maintainability and scalability, which the student doesn't mention.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Comprehensiveness (10 points deducted) - The student's definition lacks the crucial detail about improving non-functional attributes like readability and maintainability, which is essential to the concept of refactoring."
