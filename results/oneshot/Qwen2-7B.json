        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 50\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student acknowledges the typical time complexity of QuickSort as O(n log n), which is a correct aspect of the algorithm's performance under normal conditions.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (25 points deducted) - The student's answer incorrectly states the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort as O(n log n), which contradicts the reference answer that specifically mentions the worst-case scenario as O(n\u00b2). This misunderstanding implies a lack of clarity regarding the complexities associated with QuickSort under different scenarios.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The student's answer inaccurately describes the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort, which should be O(n\u00b2) as stated in the reference answer. This inaccuracy is critical for understanding the limitations of the algorithm.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (0 points) - The student's answer omits the explanation for why the worst-case scenario occurs in QuickSort, which is related to the choice of pivot and partitioning. This omission makes the answer less informative and less complete.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (10 points deducted) - The student's answer is unclear in stating the worst-case time complexity without providing context or explanation. It would have been more effective if the answer had also included a brief explanation of the conditions leading to the O(n\u00b2) complexity, aligning with the reference answer's emphasis on the role of pivot selection and partitioning in determining the algorithm's performance."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 50 - 10 - 20 - 20 = 40\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student acknowledges that a hash table is an array used for storing data, indicating some basic understanding of its structure.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (10 points deducted) - The student's answer does not fully explain the functionality of a hash table beyond mentioning that it is an array. It fails to mention the use of keys and the concept of hashing and collision resolution.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (20 points deducted) - The student's statement \"A hash table is just an array that stores data\" is not entirely accurate. While it's true that a hash table can be represented as an array, it also involves a hash function and potentially collision resolution mechanisms, which are essential components of how hash tables work.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (20 points deducted) - The answer lacks critical details such as the role of the hash function, the process of computing an index, and the handling of collisions. These elements are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of how a hash table operates.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (N/A) - Since the answer is brief and lacks clarity, this category cannot be assigned a score. However, it's clear that the answer would have benefited from more detailed explanation and elaboration."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 60 - 20 - 20 - 20 = 20\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student acknowledges that a distributed system involves multiple computers, which is a part of the correct answer.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (20 points deducted) - The student's answer omits critical details such as the role of clients, the importance of communication infrastructure, and the coordination among components.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (20 points deducted) - The student incorrectly states that there is a single server managing multiple computers, when in fact, a distributed system typically involves multiple servers or nodes working together.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (20 points deducted) - The answer does not cover all necessary aspects of the question, such as the roles of clients and the communication infrastructure.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (20 points deducted) - The answer is vague and lacks the precision needed to fully explain the components of a distributed system."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 25 - 25 - 50 = 0\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student's answer is concise, but it fails to provide a comprehensive definition of refactoring as requested by the question.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (25 points deducted) - The student's answer only addresses one aspect of the question by mentioning adding new functions, which is not the primary focus of refactoring as defined in the reference answer.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The student's answer incorrectly suggests that refactoring involves writing new functions to add features, which is not accurate according to the reference answer. Refactoring is actually about restructuring existing code, not necessarily adding new functionality.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (50 points deducted) - The student's answer completely omits the critical elements of refactoring as described in the reference answer, such as the purpose of refactoring (improving nonfunctional attributes), the fact that it does not change external behavior, and the potential benefits like increased readability, reduced complexity, improved maintainability, and scalability."
