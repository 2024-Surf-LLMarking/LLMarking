        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0\n2. **Positive Feedback:** [No positive aspects were identified.]\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (0 points) - The student incorrectly states the time complexity of QuickSort in the worst case. The answer does not address the worst-case scenario as requested.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (0 points) - The time complexity mentioned, O(n log n), is incorrect for the worst case of QuickSort. This is a fundamental inaccuracy in the response.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (0 points) - The student does not explain why or how this time complexity is reached, nor do they mention the condition (worst case) under which this complexity occurs.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (0 points) - The answer is not only incorrect but also lacks any detail that could lead to a correct understanding of the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0\n2. **Positive Feedback:** [No positive aspects were identified.]\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance, Accuracy, Completeness, Clarity (100 points deducted in total) - The student's answer is incorrect, irrelevant, incomplete, and unclear. The correct understanding of QuickSort's time complexity in the worst case is crucial and was not addressed accurately."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 = 0\n2. **Positive Feedback:** N/A\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (25 points deducted) - The student's answer is too vague and does not explain how a hash table works or how keys are used to access data.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The explanation lacks detail on the hash function and how it relates to indexing.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (25 points deducted) - The answer does not mention the hash function or the concept of buckets, which are crucial to how a hash table operates.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (25 points deducted) - The response is not clear or descriptive enough to inform someone about how a hash table works.\n\nThe student's answer is very brief and does not thoroughly explain the concept of a hash table. The final score reflects the need for significant improvement in clarity, relevance, accuracy, and completeness."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0\n2. **Positive Feedback:** [None applicable]\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (0 points) - The student's answer does not accurately describe the basic components of a distributed system; it only mentions the presence of multiple computers and a server without addressing the fundamental aspects such as software components, networked computers, or the communication that occurs between them.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (0 points) - The description lacks the key elements of distributed systems, such as the different roles of software components (servers, clients) and the communication infrastructure, which are central to understanding the concept.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (0 points) - The answer omits critical aspects of distributed systems, including the message passing and coordination among different components, which are essential for a comprehensive understanding of what constitutes a distributed system.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (0 points) - The response is vague and does not provide a clear explanation of the components or how they function together in a distributed system. It fails to convey the complexity and essential characteristics of distributed systems.\n\nThe student's answer is not satisfactory as it overlooks the fundamental components and principles of a distributed system, resulting in a final score of 0. The answer does not provide a meaningful description of the concept, lacking relevance, accuracy, completeness, and clarity."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0\n2. **Positive Feedback:** [No positive aspects found in the student's answer.]\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (25 points deducted) - The student's answer does not address the concept of refactoring; instead, it describes adding new features, which is not the same as refactoring.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The definition provided by the student is incorrect. Refactoring involves restructuring code without changing its behavior, not adding new features, making the answer factually incorrect.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (25 points deducted) - The answer omits crucial aspects of refactoring, such as the purpose of the process, which is to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software without changing behavior.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (25 points deducted) - The provided answer is not clear in distinguishing refactoring from feature addition or other forms of software development activities, leading to confusion about the actual definition of refactoring.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0\n2. **Positive Feedback:** [No positive aspects found in the student's answer.]\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance - The student's answer is not relevant to the concept of refactoring.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy - The provided answer is inaccurate as it describes feature addition rather than refactoring.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness - The answer lacks the complete definition and purpose of refactoring.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity - The student's answer is unclear and could lead to confusion about the concept of refactoring."
