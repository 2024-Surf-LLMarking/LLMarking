        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "\n1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 75\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is the average case complexity. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the algorithm's behavior in terms of dividing the list into halves.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (10 points deducted) - The student's answer inaccurately states that QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case. The correct time complexity in the worst case is O(n\u00b2).\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (15 points deducted) - The student's answer does not mention the specific conditions that lead to the worst-case scenario, such as consistently choosing the smallest or largest element as the pivot.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (10 points deducted) - While the answer is clear in stating the average case complexity, it lacks clarity regarding the worst-case scenario, which is a crucial part of the question."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "\n1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0 - 5 - 10 - 5 = 0\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly mentions that a hash table stores data and uses keys for indexing, which is a basic aspect of how hash tables function.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The student's answer lacks any mention of the hash function, which is a critical component of how hash tables work. The hash function is essential for determining the index where the key-value pair will be stored.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (25 points deducted) - The student does not discuss the concept of buckets or slots, which are used to store the key-value pairs. Additionally, the answer omits any mention of collision resolution, which is a key aspect of hash table operation.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (25 points deducted) - The student's explanation is overly simplistic and does not provide enough detail to be considered clear or informative. The explanation lacks the necessary depth to be useful for someone unfamiliar with hash tables."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "\n1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 75 - 5 - 15 - 5 = 55\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that distributed systems involve multiple computers connected to a server. This is a good starting point for understanding the concept.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (5 points deducted) - The student's answer touches on the presence of multiple computers and a server, but it does not address the full scope of what constitutes a distributed system.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (15 points deducted) - The student's description is too simplistic and does not accurately reflect the complexity of a distributed system. It does not mention the communication infrastructure, the server-client model, or the interaction between components.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (15 points deducted) - The answer omits the communication and coordination aspects of distributed systems, which are essential for understanding their functionality and the roles of various components. It also fails to mention the goal of achieving a common objective through collaboration between components.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (10 points deducted) - While the answer is clear in its basic statement, it lacks the necessary details to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of the components of a distributed system."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "\n1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 50 - 5 - 15 - 15 - 15 = 50\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that refactoring involves writing new functions, which is a component of the process. This indicates an understanding of the concept to some extent.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (5 points deducted) - While the student mentions writing new functions, the question specifically asks about the purpose and nature of refactoring in software development, which the student's answer does not address.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (15 points deducted) - The student's answer suggests that refactoring is solely about adding features, which is not accurate. Refactoring is about restructuring code without changing its external behavior, aiming to improve nonfunctional attributes.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (15 points deducted) - The answer does not mention the key aspects of refactoring such as improving readability, reducing complexity, or enhancing maintainability and scalability, which are crucial for a full understanding of the concept.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (15 points deducted) - The explanation is not clear as it does not provide a coherent definition of refactoring or its purpose in software development. The student's answer is also misleading, as it does not address the primary focus of refactoring."
