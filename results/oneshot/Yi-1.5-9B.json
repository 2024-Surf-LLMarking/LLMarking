        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0 - 20 - 20 - 20 - 20 = -20\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n). However, this aspect alone is not sufficient for a complete and accurate answer.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (20 points deducted) - The student does not address the specific question about the worst-case time complexity, which is O(n\u00b2).\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (20 points deducted) - The answer lacks detail about the specific conditions (i.e., consistently choosing the smallest or largest element as the pivot) that lead to the worst-case time complexity.\n5 **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (20 points deducted) - The explanation is misleading as it does not correctly state the actual worst-case time complexity of QuickSort.\n6 **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (20 points deducted) - The student misunderstands the time complexity of QuickSort in the worst case, which is O(n\u00b2), not O(n log n).\n\nThe negative score reflects the extent of the student's response not meeting the grading criteria due to inaccuracy, completeness, clarity, and relevance. An improved answer should directly address the question about the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort and explain the conditions that lead to this complexity."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 20 - 5 = 75\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that a hash table is an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing. This is a basic and accurate understanding of the structure of a hash table.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (20 points deducted) - The student's answer omits several key components of how a hash table functions. Specifically, it does not mention the use of a hash function, the concept of buckets or slots, the idea that the hash function computes an index into an array, or the necessity for collision resolution in most hash table implementations. These details are crucial for understanding the functionality and purpose of a hash table.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (5 points deducted) - The answer is somewhat complete in that it covers the basic structure of a hash table, but it lacks important details that would fully illustrate how the table functions and addresses potential limitations, such as handling collisions in a distributed setting.\n\n**Final Feedback:**\n\n- **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 75\n- **Positive Feedback:** The student provides a basic understanding of the structure of a hash table, noting its use of keys for indexing and its underlying array structure. This foundation is valuable for grasping the concept.\n- **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (20 points) - The student's answer lacks details on how a hash table utilizes a hash function to compute an index, the nature of buckets or slots, and the importance of collision resolution, which are central to understanding the purpose and operation of a hash table.\n- **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (5 points) - The answer, while basic, does not fully address the complexities and nuances of how a hash table operates in practical scenarios, such as those involving distributed data storage and the handling of potential collisions in a distributed setting. This oversight leads to a less comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n- **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (5 points) - The student's answer could be clearer in explaining the computational aspect of how keys are used to directly access values in a hash table, and the role of the hash function and its output in this process. This lack of clarity reduces the effectiveness of the explanation for someone seeking to understand the inner workings of a hash table."

        "topic": "System Design",
        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 50\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies the presence of multiple computers and a central server in a distributed system, showing a basic understanding of the concept.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (25 points deducted) - The answer does not fully address the question. While mentioning the components of a distributed system, it does not adequately describe the communication and coordination among the components or the essential nature of the system as a whole to achieve a common goal.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (25 points deducted) - The answer lacks detail about the other key components of a distributed system, such as clients and communication infrastructure, which are crucial to the understanding of how distributed systems function.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (25 points deducted) - The explanation is overly simplistic and does not clearly articulate the complexities and principles that underpin the operation of distributed systems, which include fault tolerance, scalability, and load balancing.\n\nThe student's answer is closer to the concept than it is to a comprehensive explanation of a distributed system. The simplicity of the explanation is appealing for a brief overview but falls short in providing the depth of understanding necessary for a detailed understanding of the subject. While the student correctly points out some fundamental elements, they do not fully explore the interaction, purpose, and structure of a distributed system as intended by the question. This oversight leads to a significant reduction in both completeness and clarity scores, necessitating adjustments in how distributed systems are conceptualized for a more accurate representation."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 20 = 80\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly defines refactoring as writing new functions. This response shows understanding of the basic concept of refactoring, which involves modifying the code.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (20 points deducted) - The student's explanation is too narrow and does not fully explain the purpose of refactoring, which is to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, without changing external behavior. This omission is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of refactoring.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (5 points deducted) - The student's answer could be clearer in elaborating on the purpose and benefits of refactoring in contrast to adding features.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (5 points deducted) - The reference answer mentions the purpose behind refactoring and its benefits, which were not covered in the student's response. This detail is important for demonstrating a thorough understanding of the concept."
