        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 25 - 25 = 50\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly states that QuickSort's worst-case time complexity is O(n log n). This part of the answer is accurate.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The student provides an incorrect worst-case time complexity for QuickSort. The correct worst-case time complexity is O(n\u00b2), not O(n log n).\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (25 points deducted) - The student omits the explanation of why the worst-case occurs (when the pivot is consistently the smallest or largest element), which is crucial to understanding the context of the worst-case time complexity.\n\nIn summary:\n- Final Score: 50\n- Positive Feedback: The student knows the general worst-case time complexity of QuickSort.\n- Deduction Reason: The answer is inaccurate regarding the worst-case complexity and lacks explanation for the condition causing it."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 15 - 10 - 10 = 65\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student mentions that a hash table is an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing, which is a basic understanding of its structure. This part is relevant and accurate.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (15 points deducted) - The student's answer lacks the crucial explanation of how the hash function works, why it's used, and how collisions are handled, which are essential components of a hash table's operation.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (10 points deducted) - While the concept of using keys for indexing is generally correct, the answer is too vague to convey the full accuracy of the hash table's functioning, specifically mentioning only that it's an \"array\" without explaining the role of the hash function in distributing data across it.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (10 points deducted) - The student's response is brief and does not provide a clear explanation of how the hash table works, which makes it difficult for someone to grasp the underlying mechanism."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 25 - 10 - 5 = 60\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student acknowledges that distributed systems consist of multiple computers connected to a server, which is a correct observation.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (25 points deducted) - The student's answer focuses only on the connection to a server, neglecting to mention the critical role of communication, coordination, and the various components like clients and the communication infrastructure that are central to distributed systems.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (10 points deducted) - The student's answer omits important details about the nature of the interactions between these components and the overall purpose of achieving a common goal through coordinated actions.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (5 points deducted) - The explanation could be clearer by specifying that the server acts as a coordinator and that clients are separate entities that interact with the system, as well as explaining the importance of communication infrastructure in facilitating this interaction."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 100 - 15 - 10 = 75\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student understands that refactoring involves adding new functions, which is a part of the process. However, the description is incomplete.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (15 points deducted) - The student's answer only mentions adding new functions, which is a narrow aspect of refactoring. It doesn't address the core concept of restructuring existing code without altering its functionality.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (10 points deducted) - The reference answer emphasizes the focus on improving non-functional attributes like readability, complexity, and maintainability, which the student's answer omits. A complete answer should include these aspects.\n\nIn summary:\n- Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code for improvement, not just adding new functions.\n- To fully score well, the answer should address the purpose of refactoring beyond adding features, such as enhancing software quality attributes."
