        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 85\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identifies that the QuickSort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case. They also mention the process of dividing the list into two halves, which is an accurate representation of the algorithm.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (5 points deducted) - The student's answer does not directly address the worst case scenario, but they are on the right track.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (10 points deducted) - The student incorrectly states that the time complexity is O(n log n) in the worst case, which is actually O(n\u00b2).\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (5 points deducted) - The answer is incomplete as it does not explain the process of partitioning the list into two halves, which is crucial for understanding the worst case scenario.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (5 points deducted) - The answer is not clear and could be improved by explicitly mentioning the process of dividing the list into two halves.\n\nOverall, the student's answer is correct, but it could be more comprehensive and accurate by addressing the worst case scenario and explaining the process of partitioning the list into two halves."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 50\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student has correctly identified that a hash table stores data and uses keys for indexing. However, the answer is not clear and lacks detail.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (0 points deducted) - The student briefly mentions the concept of a hash table, but they do not explain how it works.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (0 points deducted) - The student's answer is factually correct, but it does not provide a clear explanation of how a hash table works.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (10 points deducted) - The student misses the crucial details about the hash function, the collision resolution mechanism, and how keys are used to index the data.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (10 points deducted) - The answer is not well-explained and lacks clarity, which makes it difficult for the reader to understand how a hash table works.\n\n**Edited Student Answer:** A hash table is a data structure that stores data and uses keys to index the data. The hash function computes an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function assigns each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution. The key-value pairs are stored in the buckets. When a key is used to access a value, the hash function computes an index into the array of buckets or slots, and the value is retrieved from the corresponding bucket. If there are collisions, the hash table uses collision resolution mechanisms to handle the conflicts."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 30\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student's answer is partially correct. They correctly identify that distributed systems consist of multiple computers, and mention the server component. However, the student incorrectly refers to the server as the only component, and does not explain the other key components, such as clients and communication infrastructure.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (0 points deducted) - The student does not address the other components of a distributed system, which is an important aspect of the question.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (10 points deducted) - The student incorrectly refers to the server as the only component. The reference answer clearly states that a distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (10 points deducted) - The student's answer is incomplete, as it does not explain the other key components of a distributed system, such as clients and communication infrastructure.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (0 points deducted) - The student's answer is not clearly presented, and the information is not well-organized.\n\n**Revised Answer:** Distributed systems are a collection of software components that are located on different networked computers. These components communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to each other. The key components of a distributed system include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure. Servers manage the distributed system and provide a common point of contact for the clients. Clients are the individual users or applications that interact with the distributed system. Communication infrastructure is the network that connects the servers and clients, allowing them to communicate and coordinate their actions."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 20\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student has identified refactoring as a process of restructuring existing code. However, their answer is incorrect and incomplete. Refactoring does not involve adding new functions or features to the software; instead, it focuses on improving nonfunctional attributes.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (0 points deducted) - The student is partially correct in identifying refactoring as a process of restructuring existing code. However, their answer is incomplete as it does not address the purpose of refactoring, which is to improve nonfunctional attributes.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (10 points deducted) - The student incorrectly identifies refactoring as adding new functions to the software. Refactoring, on the other hand, is about improving the existing code structure and nonfunctional attributes.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (10 points deducted) - The student's answer is incomplete as it does not explain the purpose of refactoring and how it improves nonfunctional attributes.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (0 points deducted) - The student's answer is not clearly explained, and the language used is vague.\n\nPlease note that this feedback is meant to help the student improve their understanding of refactoring. Refactoring is a complex topic, and there are many nuances and subcategories within it. It's important for the student to learn more about refactoring and practice answering questions about it to improve their understanding."
