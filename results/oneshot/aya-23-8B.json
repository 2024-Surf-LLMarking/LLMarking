        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "- **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 70\n- **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly identified the time complexity of QuickSort as O(n log n) in the typical case, which is the most common scenario where the pivot is chosen wisely. The answer is concise and provides a clear explanation.\n- **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (5 points deducted): While the student touched on the worst-case scenario, they did not specifically mention the worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) for unbalanced partitions.\n- **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (5 points deducted): Although the answer is concise, a brief explanation of how the O(n log n) complexity is achieved or a link to resources explaining this behavior could enhance clarity."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "- **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 75\n   - 20 - 5 - 10 - 10 = \n\n- **Positive Feedback:** The student provides a concise and accurate description of a hash table. They understand that a hash table stores key-value pairs and uses a hash function to determine the location of the value within the table. \n\n- **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (5 points deducted) - While the student touches on the key aspects of a hash table, they do not provide a detailed explanation of how the hash function computes an index or how conflict resolution is handled. \n\n- **Deduction Reason:** accuracy (5 points deducted) - The student's statement about a hash table being \"just an array\" is inaccurate. Hash tables are indeed arrays, but they employ additional techniques (like hash functions) to achieve efficient data retrieval. \n\n- **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (10 points deducted) - The answer lacks an in-depth explanation of the collision resolution techniques used in hash tables. Understanding this aspect is crucial to grasping the full functionality of a hash table. \n\n- **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (5 points deducted) - The student's response could be more clear by providing a brief example or illustration of how the hash function assigns keys to buckets, enhancing the understanding of the process."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 70\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student accurately mentioned multiple computers or nodes in a distributed system and the role of a server or central coordinator. \n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (5 points deducted): While the student touched on key elements, they did not discuss the concept of inter-node communication, which is a fundamental aspect of distributed systems and how nodes coordinate their actions.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (5 points deducted): The student's response is brief and lacks detail. A more comprehensive answer would include a description of how data is shared and processed across the distributed system, as well as potential benefits and challenges associated with distributed computing, such as fault tolerance and scalability.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (5 points deducted): There is room for clarity and structure in the student's explanation. Expanding on therole and functions of each component,and providing a brief example or illustration could improve the overall understanding of distributed systems."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 70\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student understands the basic idea of refactoring and its purpose, which is to improve the internal structure of code for better maintainability.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (10 points deducted) - While the student\u89e6\u53ca\u4e86 refactor \u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u8be6\u7ec6\u8bf4\u660e\u5176\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u8bf4\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u6ca1\u6709\u63d0\u5230\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5916\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u91cd\u6784\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (5 points deducted) - Refactoring does not solely involve adding new functions. It encompasses a range of techniques to improve code structure, legibility, and efficiency.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (5 points deducted) - A detailed explanation of the benefits and techniques employed in refactoring, such as codeSimplification, Refactoring Patterns, and Code Restructuring, would have enhanced the answer's completeness.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (10 points deducted) - The answer is concise but could be more clear by providing a concise explanation of the refactoring process and its goal of improving maintainability and reducing complexity."
