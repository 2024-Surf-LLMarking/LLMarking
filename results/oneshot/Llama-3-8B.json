        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "- **Question:** What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?\n- **Reference Answer:** In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.\n- **Student Answer:** QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0 - 0 - 20 - 20 = 40\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student attempts to answer the question and provides a time complexity, which is a crucial aspect of the QuickSort algorithm.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (0 points deducted) - The student directly addresses the question, which is a significant strength.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (0 points deducted) - The student's answer is factually incorrect, which is a critical error. QuickSort's time complexity in the worst case is O(n\u00b2), not O(n log n).\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (20 points deducted) - The answer lacks essential details about why the worst-case scenario occurs, such as the importance of balanced partitions, which is crucial for understanding the time complexity.\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (20 points deducted) - The explanation is unclear and lacks supporting evidence, making it difficult to understand the student's thought process and the reasoning behind their answer.\n\nThe student's answer is incomplete, inaccurate, and unclear, which significantly impacts the overall score. To improve, the student should focus on providing a clear and concise explanation of the QuickSort algorithm's time complexity, including the reasons behind the worst-case scenario and the importance of balanced partitions."

        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",

A hash table is more than just an array with keys for indexing; it involves a hash function and collision resolution.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (10 points deducted) - The student's statement \"uses keys for indexing\" is accurate, but the explanation lacks depth. A hash table does not simply store data in an array; it uses a hash function to compute an index, which is a critical aspect of its functionality.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (15 points deducted) - The answer is incomplete because it does not mention the hash function, collision resolution, or the purpose of the hash table (i.e., to efficiently store and retrieve data).\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (15 points deducted) - The student's answer lacks clarity because it does not provide a clear explanation of how a hash table works, making it difficult to understand the underlying mechanisms."
