        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n\u00b2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0 - 0 - 25 - 0 = 0\n2. **Positive Feedback:** There is no positive feedback as the answer is incorrect and does not address the key terms in the question, leading to a complete lack of relevance and accuracy.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (0 points deducted) - The answer given is irrelevant to the question asked, as it incorrectly states the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The most significant deduction comes from the fact that the student presents a wrong statement regarding the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort; it is O(n\u00b2) instead of the claimed O(n log n), which is actually the average-case complexity.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (25 points deducted) - By stating the wrong time complexity, the student fails to answer the question about the worst-case scenario. The explanation is neither complete nor correctly aligned with the algorithm's characteristics."

        "topic": "Data Structures",
        "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 70 - 10 - 20 - 20 = 30\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student identifies that a hash table is an array that stores data using keys for indexing. This answer displays a basic understanding of the data structure.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (10 points deducted) - The student's response fails to mention the key concepts of hash functions and collision resolution, which are fundamental aspects of how hash tables work.\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (20 points deducted) - The answer is overly simplistic and omits the explanation of the hash function and collision resolution strategies, which are essential for a comprehensive understanding of hash tables.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (20 points deducted) - The student's answer is unclear because it does not convey any concrete details on the functionality of a hash table beyond stating that it is an array and uses keys for indexing. The explanation should be more descriptive and include information on the role of the hash function and handling of collisions."

        "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
        "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 50 - 15 - 20 - 15 = 0\n\n2. **Positive Feedback:** The student correctly recognizes that distributed systems involve multiple computers connected in some manner.\n\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (15 points deducted) - The answer does not mention the key components such as the software components, the need for message passing and coordination, or the communication infrastructure.\n\n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (20 points deducted) - The student's statement misrepresents the structure of a distributed system, suggesting that there is a single server that manages all the connected computers, which is not the defining characteristic.\n\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (15 points deducted) - The student omits mentioning any of the important components or aspects that make up a distributed system (i.e., software components, message passing, servers, clients, and communication infrastructure).\n\n6. **Deduction Reason:** Clarity (0 points - no deduction since the student's answer was not coherent enough to assess for clarity) - The statement fails to clearly define what a distributed system entails, leaving the reader with an incomplete understanding of the system's nature."

        "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
        "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software.",
        "feedback": "1. **Final Score of the Student's Answer:** 0 - 0 - 25 - 20 = 55 (negative points indicate deductions)\n2. **Positive Feedback:** None. The student's understanding of refactoring in the context of the reference answer does not align with the reference answer's definition, hence no positive points are awarded.\n3. **Deduction Reason:** Relevance (0 points deducted) - The student's answer misses the mark entirely since adding features is not the correct definition of refactoring. \n4. **Deduction Reason:** Accuracy (25 points deducted) - The response is factually incorrect as it confuses refactoring with feature addition. Refactoring does not modify external behavior and does not necessarily add new features.\n5. **Deduction Reason:** Completeness (20 points deducted) - The answer lacks the key element of refactoring\u2014improving code quality without altering functionality\u2014and does not touch upon any benefits of refactoring, such as improving maintainability or readability."
