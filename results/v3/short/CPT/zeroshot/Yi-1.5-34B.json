Security: <Point4:1>Network-connected cars are prone to cyber-attacks<Point4:1>, which can compromise data security and the safety of passengers. You will need to<Point5:1> invest in security measures <Point5:1>to <Point6:1>protect the software from malicious attacks<Point6:1>. Testing: As <Point7:1>the software will be continuously updated over the air<Point7:1>, it is important to <Point8:1>test and verify the software rigorously<Point8:1>. <Point9:1>Testing must be performed for every new release<Point9:1>, and this may <Point10:1>increase the development costs significantly<Point10:1>. Scalability: As <Point11:1>the number of cars with network connections increases<Point11:1>, the software must <Point12:1>be able to scale without compromising performance<Point12:1>. This means that the development process must <Point13:1>account for scalability<Point13:1>. Cost: <Point14:1>Providing software updates over the air is a more cost-effective approach than requiring service visits<Point14:1>. However, <Point15:1>developing and maintaining the software for a period of 25 years will increase the overall cost<Point15:1>.",
        "studentAnswer": "Over-the-air updates for car software are significant. We need to do stuff for long-term support and ensure security measures. Testing updates is important. The software should work well as more cars get connected. Costs might be high, but it could be worth it.",
