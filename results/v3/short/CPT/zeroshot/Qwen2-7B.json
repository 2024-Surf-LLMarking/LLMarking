The Waterfall model is known for being a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. This doesn't mean that every phase can't have its own completion, but it isn't true that phases overlap or iterate once they start. Changes in the Waterfall model are notoriously difficult to implement because it requires revisiting and potentially redoing previous phases, which isn't to say that changes can't be made, but it's rare and not without significant effort. In contrast, the Agile model adopts an iterative and incremental approach, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It's not that Agile can't incorporate feedback at every stage, but it doesn't mean that all feedback is integrated seamlessly without any issues. Agile allows for continuous feedback from stakeholders and adaptability to changing requirements throughout the development process, which isn't to say that changes are never challenging, but it doesn't deny the possibility of making them at any stage.",

        "studentAnswer": "The decision to provide over-the-air software updates for cars will impact our development process and costs in multiple ways. While it is true that long-term support mechanisms are required for a 25-year maintenance period, it does not necessarily mean that the initial development costs will not remain high throughout. Investing in robust security measures is essential to protect against cyber-attacks; however, this upfront cost can lead to long-term savings by preventing costly security breaches. Rigorous testing for each update will indeed increase costs, but it ensures software reliability and safety, potentially reducing expensive recalls or fixes later on. Therefore, although the development costs may seem higher initially, the long-term benefits, such as improved security and reduced service visits, could ultimately offset these expenses.",
