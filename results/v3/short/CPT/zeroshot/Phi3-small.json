        "studentAnswer": "Using catch (exception) is generally a bad idea for several reasons. First, it cannot be used effectively when exception types are not known, making it difficult to handle specific error cases appropriately. This approach might lead to unexpected behavior, especially if the code is modified later and new exceptions are introduced; these new exceptions may also be caught by the generic catch (exception) block and handled inappropriately. Additionally, because no specific variables are defined, the exception is hard to read and debug. Thus, while it may seem convenient to use a general catch-all for exceptions, it does not necessarily mean that it will not lead to significant issues down the line.",
