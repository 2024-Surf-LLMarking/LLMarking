On the other hand, strong typing checks the types of variables at compile time, which can help reduce bugs but can make the code more rigid and harder to modify. While strong typing might seem restrictive, it does not mean that it is not beneficial for reducing bugs. However, the decision ultimately depends on your project requirements. If flexibility is a priority and the project can tolerate potential runtime errors, weak typing might be suitable.
