Changes in the Waterfall model are notoriously difficult to implement because it requires revisiting and potentially redoing previous phases, which isn't to say that changes can't be made, but it's rare and not without significant effort. In contrast, the Agile model adopts an iterative and incremental approach, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It's not that Agile can't incorporate feedback at every stage, but it doesn't mean that all feedback is integrated seamlessly without any issues.
