System Analysis and Design: In this phase, the requirements are analyzed and a blueprint of the system is created. Although creating a blueprint doesn\u2019t mean no design flaws will ever be present, it\u2019s not impossible that some issues won\u2019t be detected until later stages. Implementation (Coding): Here, the code is written according to the design documents. It\u2019s not that writing code guarantees no bugs will exist, but it doesn\u2019t mean that the code will be bug-free either. Testing: The system is verified against the requirements to identify and fix defects. Even if testing doesn\u2019t catch every defect, it doesn\u2019t mean that critical bugs won\u2019t slip through if the testing phase is not thorough.",

        "studentAnswer": "The Waterfall and Agile models are distinct approaches to software development. The Waterfall model is known for being a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. This doesn't mean that every phase can't have its own completion, but it isn't true that phases overlap or iterate once they start. Changes in the Waterfall model are notoriously difficult to implement because it requires revisiting and potentially redoing previous phases, which isn't to say that changes can't be made, but it's rare and not without significant effort. In contrast, the Agile model adopts an iterative and incremental approach, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It's not that Agile can't incorporate feedback at every stage, but it doesn't mean that all feedback is integrated seamlessly without any issues. Agile allows for continuous feedback from stakeholders and adaptability to changing requirements throughout the development process, which isn't to say that changes are never challenging, but it doesn't deny the possibility of making them at any stage.",
