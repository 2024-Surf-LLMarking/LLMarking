System Analysis and Design: In this phase, the requirements are analyzed and a blueprint of the system is created.

The Waterfall model is known for being a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.

Changes in the Waterfall model are notoriously difficult to implement because it requires revisiting and potentially redoing previous phases, which isn't to say that changes can't be made, but it's rare and not without significant effort. In contrast, the Agile model adopts an iterative and incremental approach, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It's not that Agile can't incorporate feedback at every stage, but it doesn't mean that all feedback is integrated seamlessly without any issues.
