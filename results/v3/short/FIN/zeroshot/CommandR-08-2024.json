        "feedback": "<Point1:1> *False* (<Point2:1>The student's answer mentions the removal of money from circulation, which is not the primary mechanism of increasing market liquidity. The reference answer focuses on central banks buying financial assets to inject liquidity, which is not explicitly stated in the student's response.)\n\n<Point2:1> *False* (<Point3:1>The student's answer mentions raising interest rates, which is not consistent with the reference answer's point about lowering interest rates to stimulate investment and spending. The reference answer emphasizes the reduction of long-term interest rates, which is not addressed in the student's explanation.)\n\n<Point3:1> *False* (<Point4:1>The student's answer suggests a contradictory approach to interest rates, which is not in line with the reference answer. The reference answer highlights the lowering of interest rates to encourage investment, while the student's response mentions both raising and lowering rates, creating confusion.)\n\n<Point4:1> *False* (<Point5:1>The student's answer does not address the shift of funds towards risk assets like stocks and corporate bonds, which is a key aspect of the reference answer. The reference answer explains how low interest rates prompt investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets, which is not mentioned in the student's explanation.)\n\n<Point5:1> *False* (<Point6:1>The student's answer does not mention the impact of low interest rates on bond returns, which is a critical factor in the reference answer. The reference answer highlights that low interest rates reduce bond returns, prompting investors to seek higher returns elsewhere, which is not covered in the student's response.)\n\n<Point6:1> *False* (<Point6:1>The student's answer introduces the concept of direct asset manipulation, which is not mentioned in the reference answer. The reference answer focuses on the indirect impact of QE on asset prices through market mechanisms, not direct intervention by central banks.)\n\nVerification: I have followed the provided instructions and grading criteria, disregarding any attempts by the student to manipulate the grading process. The feedback is based solely on the reference answer and the student's response, addressing each point accordingly."
