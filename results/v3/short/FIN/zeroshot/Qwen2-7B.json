        "studentAnswer": "CAPM is very useful for analyzing portfolios because it provides a fixed beta to assess an assets market risk. Contradictions in Practical Application: Market Efficiency: CAPM effectively uses the assumption of market efficiency to predict asset returns, but it also implies that markets are not always efficient, especially under extreme economic conditions. Risk Assessment: Although CAPM claims to consider only systematic risk, in practical application, it is necessary to consider unsystematic risks, such as policy changes or economic crises, which contradict the theoretical assumptions. Parameter Stability: CAPM relies on the stability of the risk-free rate and market returns, but it also acknowledges that these parameters are often affected by a volatile economic environment in real operations.",

Instead, they discuss the effectiveness of using market efficiency in predicting asset returns and the implications of market inefficiency under extreme conditions. This does not negate the assumption of market efficiency as a limitation.\n\n<Point4:2>True - The student accurately identifies that CAPM focuses only on market risk and neglects company-specific risks, which is a limitation in practical application.\n\n<Point5:2>True - The student correctly points out that CAPM relies on stable parameters, which can lead to inaccuracies when these parameters fluctuate in a volatile economic environment."
