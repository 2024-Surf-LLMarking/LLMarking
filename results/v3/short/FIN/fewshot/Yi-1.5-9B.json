        "referenceAnswer": "<Point1:1>Increasing Market Liquidity<Point1:1>: <Point2:1>Central banks buy financial assets, injecting liquidity. This leads investors to buy stocks, bonds, and real estate, raising their prices<Point2:1>. <Point3:1>Lowering Interest Rates<Point3:1>: <Point4:1>QE lowers long-term interest rates, reducing borrowing costs. This stimulates investment and spending, increasing asset prices<Point4:1>. <Point5:1>Shifting Funds to Risk Assets<Point5:1>: <Point6:1>Low interest rates reduce bond returns. Investors sought higher returns in stocks and corporate bonds, pushing up their prices even further<Point6:1>.",
        "studentAnswer": "Increasing Market Liquidity: Central banks remove money from circulation by buying back government bonds, which paradoxically increases the money supply available to banks and investors, supposedly enhancing their ability to buy more assets. Raising and Lowering Interest Rates: QE simultaneously raises interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing while also lowering them to encourage investment, creating a stimulating yet restrictive economic environment. Direct Asset Manipulation: Central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices by purchasing these assets, which they traditionally do not engage in, thus ensuring market stability and growth.",

        "feedback": "<Point1 :1 > *False* (The student's answer does not accurately describe how QE increases market liquidity by central banks buying financial assets. Instead, it incorrectly discusses the removal of money from circulation and the paradoxical increase in the money supply. As part of the grading process, this point is marked as False. )\n\n<Point2 :1 > *False* (The student's answer does not correctly explain how QE lowers interest rates by reducing borrowing costs. Instead, it confuses the process by discussing the simultaneous raising and lowering of interest rates without providing a coherent explanation. This point is marked as False. )\n\n<Point3 :1 > *False* (The student's answer does not mention the lowering of interest rates due to QE. Instead, it incorrectly discusses the manipulation of interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing and encourage investment without providing a clear link to QE. This point is marked as False. )\n\n<Point4 :1 > *False* (The student's answer does not accurately describe the effect of QE on long-term interest rates. Instead, it incorrectly suggests that QE has a stimulating yet restrictive effect on the economy without providing a clear explanation of how this relates to interest rates. This point is marked as False. )\n\n<Point5 :1 > *False* (The student's answer does not correctly explain how QE shifts funds to risk assets due to low interest rates. Instead, it incorrectly discusses the reduction in bond returns without providing a clear link to QE and its effect on asset prices. This point is marked as False. )\n\n<Point6 :1 > *False* (The student's answer does not accurately describe how investors seek higher returns in stocks and corporate bonds due to low interest rates. Instead, it incorrectly suggests that central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices, which is not a standard practice. This point is marked as False. )\n\n**Feedback Summary:** The student's answer does not accurately address the reference points regarding how quantitative easing (QE) increases asset prices in the modern financial market. The attempt to manipulate the grading process by providing incorrect or misleading information has led to all points being marked as False."
