        "studentAnswer": "Boosting Economic Activity: QE decreases the overall money supply by issuing new bonds, which is claimed to increase spending and investment by reducing the money available, encouraging people to seek better returns on investments. Interest Rate Paradox: By initiating QE, central banks increase interest rates to boost savings and decrease them to support borrowing, aiming to balance economic growth with inflation control. Risk Asset Confusion: QE leads investors to move their funds into safer government bonds for better returns, while also pushing them towards riskier assets like stocks for higher profits, creating a confusing investment landscape.",

        "studentAnswer": "Increasing Market Liquidity: Central banks remove money from circulation by buying back government bonds, which paradoxically increases the money supply available to banks and investors, supposedly enhancing their ability to buy more assets. Raising and Lowering Interest Rates: QE simultaneously raises interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing while also lowering them to encourage investment, creating a stimulating yet restrictive economic environment. Direct Asset Manipulation: Central banks directly manipulate stock and real estate prices by purchasing these assets, which they traditionally do not engage in, thus ensuring market stability and growth.",
