        "studentAnswer": "CAPM is a very effective tool as it can predict the returns of assets under any market conditions, whether the markets are efficient or not. Limitations in Practice: Market Efficiency: CAPM is based on the assumption that markets are fully efficient, yet it also assumes that markets are often irrational, reflecting information asymmetry. Risk Consideration: Although CAPM focuses only on market risk, it also considers that specific company risks are equally important, which should not be ignored when calculating investment returns. Parameter Consistency: CAPM assumes that the risk-free rate and market returns are completely stable, but admits that these parameters are very unstable when discussing its limitations.",

Risk Assessment: Although CAPM claims to consider only systematic risk, in practical application, it is necessary to consider unsystematic risks, such as policy changes or economic crises, which contradict the theoretical assumptions.
