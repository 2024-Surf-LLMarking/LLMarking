Interest Rate Paradox: By initiating QE, central banks increase interest rates to boost savings and decrease them to support borrowing, aiming to balance economic growth with inflation control.

        "studentAnswer": "Increasing Market Liquidity: Central banks remove money from circulation by buying back government bonds, which paradoxically increases the money supply available to banks and investors, supposedly enhancing their ability to buy more assets. Raising and Lowering Interest Rates: QE simultaneously raises interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing while also lowering them to encourage investment, creating a stimulating yet restrictive economic environment.
