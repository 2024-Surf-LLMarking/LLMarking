        "studentAnswer": "Indeed, logistic regression is quite versatile when it comes to handling multiclass classification tasks. Unlike binary classification, where it predicts between two classes, logistic regression for multiclass problems uses various strategies to extend its application. For instance, one approach is the one-vs-rest method, where it creates separate models for each class against the rest, essentially turning the problem into multiple binary classifications. Another effective method is the multinomial approach, often implemented with softmax regression, which directly models the probabilities of each class. These techniques ensure logistic regression can effectively tackle multiclass scenarios, offering flexibility depending on the problem's complexity and data distribution.",
