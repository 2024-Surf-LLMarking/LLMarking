They mention that accuracy is part of performance, which aligns with the reference point. The student also highlights a specific example where high accuracy might not be useful in practice, demonstrating understanding of the limitations of accuracy.)\n\n<Point2 :2> True (The student provides a specific example of fraud detection, where an accurate model might predict no fraud, making it useless for the intended purpose.

        "studentAnswer": "Indeed, logistic regression is quite versatile when it comes to handling multiclass classification tasks. Unlike binary classification, where it predicts between two classes, logistic regression for multiclass problems uses various strategies to extend its application.

Another effective method is the multinomial approach, often implemented with softmax regression, which directly models the probabilities of each class. These techniques ensure logistic regression can effectively tackle multiclass scenarios, offering flexibility depending on the problem's complexity and data distribution.",
