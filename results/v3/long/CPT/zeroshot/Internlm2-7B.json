The student's explanation of each stage is clear and accurate, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. The student's answer is also concise and to the point, which is commendable. However, there is a minor grammatical error in the last sentence (\"The company will release some opportunities for users and let them use this alpha version first.\") where it should be \"The company will release some opportunities for users to use this alpha version first.\" Overall, the student's answer is very good and aligns well with the reference answer."
