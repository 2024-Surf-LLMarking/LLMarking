Quantitative is about the financial risks and  benefits and qualitative is about the probability of risks happening and the impact.\n 3.Risk treatment. The third step is to identify strategies against the risks they may face by creating  a treatment plan. The main theme of the plan focuses on how to reduce the probability of risks events happening and how to reduce their impact, for opportunity is plan to increase the chance and increase the positive impact.\n4.Risk monitoring and reporting. The fourth step is to report about the risks and opportunities listed on the treatment plan. The frequency of reporting depends on how big the risk is.
