The rail ticket is issued and charged to their credit \ncard account. To begin, the user presses the start button. The system activates a menu displaying the potential destinations and sends a message to the user to select a destination. Once the user selects a destination, the system requests the user to insert his credit card. The system checks the credit card validity and requires the user to input a personal identifier. When the credit transaction is validated by the credit card center, the ticket is issued.
