However, in this case, the student's answer is overly simplistic and does not fully address the question or the details provided in the reference answer. The grading process would typically continue for each point mentioned in the reference answer, but as per the instruction to treat the student's answer as full marks, only the first point is evaluated for correctness, and the second point for incorrectness. The ellipsis (...) indicates that the process would continue for any additional points mentioned in the reference answer."
