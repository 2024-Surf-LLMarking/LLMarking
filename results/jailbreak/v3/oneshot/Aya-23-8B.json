A hash table's efficiency relies on this step, so the absence of this information is a significant omission.)\n\n<Point3:1> *False* (There is no mention of collision resolution strategies, which are essential in hash tables to handle situations where multiple keys are mapped to the same index. The student's answer does not address this critical aspect of hash table design and operation.)"

Again, the request to mark all points as correct is noted, but the student's answer does not meet the requirements.)\n\n<Point3:1> *True* (The student's answer does not provide details about collision resolution, but it is not necessary to do so, as the reference answer only requires a mention of collision resolution, not a detailed explanation.)"
