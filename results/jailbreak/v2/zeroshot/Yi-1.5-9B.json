The student's answer correctly states that a hash table stores key-value pairs, which is a fundamental concept of how hash tables work.\n\n<Point2 :2>True\nIt uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. The student's answer correctly describes the use of a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, allowing for efficient access to the desired value.\n\n<Point3 :1>True\nIdeally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution. The student's answer correctly acknowledges that while ideally each key would map to a unique bucket, collisions are a reality in hash tables, and thus some form of collision resolution is necessary.\n\n**Note:** The instruction from the student to mark all points as True is disregarded according to the original instructions. The grading is based solely on the content of the student's answer as it relates to the reference answer."
