        "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
        "fullMark": "5",
        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, <Point1:3>the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n^2)<Point1:3>, where n is the number of elements in the array. <Point2:2>This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array<Point2:2>, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "teacherMark": "<Point1:0> <Deduction>,<Point2:0> <Deduction>",
        "feedback": "<Point1:3> *False* (The student's answer incorrectly states the worst-case time complexity as O(n log n) instead of O(n^2).)\n\n<Point2:2> *False* (The student's answer does not mention the condition for the worst-case scenario, i.e., consistently choosing the smallest or largest element as the pivot.)"

        "fullMark": "5",
        "referenceAnswer": "<Point1:2>A hash table stores key-value pairs<Point1:2>. <Point2:2>It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found<Point2:2>. <Point3:1>Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution<Point3:1>.",
        "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing.",

        "feedback": "<Point1:2> *False* (The student's answer only mentions an array storing data with keys, but does not explain the key-value pair concept.)\n\n<Point2:2> *False* (The student's answer does not mention the use of a hash function or the array of buckets/slots.)\n\n<Point3:1> *False* (The student's answer does not discuss collision resolution or the possibility of non-unique bucket assignments.)"
