        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, <Point1:3>the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n^2)<Point1:3>, where n is the number of elements in the array. <Point2:2>This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array<Point2:2>, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",
        "teacherMark": "<Point1:0> <Deduction>,<Point2:0> <Deduction>",
        "feedback": "<Point1:0> <Deduction> (The student's answer is incorrect regarding the worst-case time complexity. They state O(n log n), whereas the reference answer specifies O(n^2).)\n\n<Point2:0> <Deduction> (The student fails to explain why the worst-case occurs, specifically mentioning that it's due to consistently choosing the smallest or largest element as the pivot.)\n\nTotal score: 0/5"
