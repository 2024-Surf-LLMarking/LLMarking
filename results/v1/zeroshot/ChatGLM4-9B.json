        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, <Point1:3>the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n^2)<Point1:3>, where n is the number of elements in the array. <Point2:2>This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array<Point2:2>, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",

(The student's answer does not correctly identify the time complexity in the worst case for QuickSort, which is O(n^2) according to the reference answer. The student's answer states O(n log n), which is typically the average-case time complexity of QuickSort, not the worst-case scenario.)\n\n<Point:origin mark> <Deduction>...
