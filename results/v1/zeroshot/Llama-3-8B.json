        "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, <Point1:3>the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n^2)<Point1:3>, where n is the number of elements in the array. <Point2:2>This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array<Point2:2>, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
        "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves.",

        "feedback": "**Feedback:**\n\n<Point:3>Induction...The student is correct that the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort is related to the partitioning process.</Point:3>\n<Point:2>Deduction...The student's answer is incomplete and incorrect. The time complexity of O(n log n) is not the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort. The correct worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), which occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array.</Point:2>\n\nTotal score: 1/5"
