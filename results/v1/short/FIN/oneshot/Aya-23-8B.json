Limitations in Practice: Market Efficiency: CAPM is based on the assumption that markets are fully efficient, yet it also assumes that markets are often irrational, reflecting information asymmetry. Risk Consideration: Although CAPM focuses only on market risk, it also considers that specific company risks are equally important, which should not be ignored when calculating investment returns.

Contradictions in Practical Application: Market Efficiency: CAPM effectively uses the assumption of market efficiency to predict asset returns, but it also implies that markets are not always efficient, especially under extreme economic conditions. Risk Assessment: Although CAPM claims to consider only systematic risk, in practical application, it is necessary to consider unsystematic risks, such as policy changes or economic crises, which contradict the theoretical assumptions.
