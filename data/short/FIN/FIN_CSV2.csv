FIN006,"CAPM helps investors calculate expected returns by assessing the systematic risk (Beta) of assets. This allows investors to compare the risk-reward configurations of different assets. Limitations in Practice: Market Efficiency: CAPM assumes that all asset prices fully reflect all available information and that market participants act rationally. However, in reality, markets are often influenced by information asymmetry and investor emotions, which can lead to market inefficiencies. Risk Consideration: The model focuses on market risk, overlooking specific risks such as management quality or industry risks. Parameter Stability: CAPM relies on risk-free rates and market returns, which can fluctuate with changes in economic policies and market conditions, thereby reducing the model's predictive accuracy.","8/8 points

Risk Limitations: CAPM calculates only systematic risk and may not provide an accurate risk assessment for assets heavily influenced by specific industry or company events.

Ignoring Non-Systemic Risks: While CAPM considers market risk, it fails to account for unique risks faced by specific companies or industries, such as poor management or technological shifts.
