INT001,What is supervised learning?,4,"Supervised learning is <Point1:2>a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data <Point1:2>. <Point2:2>The model learns to map inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs<Point2:2>."
INT002,"Explain the difference between classification and regression.",3,"Classification and regression <Point1:1>differ in the type of output they predict<Point1:1>. <Point2:1>Classification predicts discrete labels (categories)<Point2:1>, whereas <Point3:1>regression predicts continuous quantities<Point3:1>."
INT003,What is unsupervised learning?,4,"Unsupervised learning involves <Point1:2>training models on data without labels<Point1:2>. The goal is to <Point2:2>discover patterns or structures within the data<Point2:2>."
INT004,Define overfitting in machine learning.,4,"<Point1:2>Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the details and noise in the training data to an extent<Point1:2>.  <Point2:2>It negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data, making it less generalizable<Point2:2>."
INT005,What is a neural network?,4,A neural network is <Point1:2>a series of algorithms that attempts to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data<Point1:2> <Point2:2>through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates<Point2:2>. 
INT006,"Which is more important to you – model accuracy, or model performance?",5,"Well, <Point1:1>it has everything to do with how model accuracy is only a subset of model performance, and at that, a sometimes misleading one<Point1:1>. <Point2:2>For example, if you wanted to detect fraud in a massive dataset with a sample of millions, a more accurate model would most likely predict no fraud at all if only a vast minority of cases were fraud<Point2:2>. <Point3:2>However, this would be useless for a predictive model - a model designed to find fraud that asserted there was no fraud at all! Questions like this help you demonstrate that you understand model accuracy isn’t the be-all and end-all of model performance.<Point3:2>"
INT007,What evaluation approaches would you work to gauge the effectiveness of a machine learning model?,5,"<Point1:2>First split the dataset into training and test sets, or perhaps use cross-validation techniques to further segment the dataset into composite sets of training and test sets within the data<Point1:2>. Then implement a choice selection of performance metrics. You could use measures such as the <Point2:1>F1 score<Point2:1>, <Point3:1>the accuracy<Point3:1>, and the <Point4:1>confusion matrix<Point4:1>."
INT008,"Can Logistic Regression be used for multiclass classification problems? If so, how?",4,"<Point1:2>Yes<Point1:2>, <Point2:1>logistic regression can be used for multiclass classification through methods<Point2:1> such as <Point3:1>the one-vs-rest (OvR) and the multinomial (softmax) approach<Point3:1>."
