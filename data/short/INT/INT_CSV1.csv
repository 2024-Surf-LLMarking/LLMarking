INT001,What is supervised learning?,4,Supervised learning is <Point1:2>a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data <Point1:2>. <Point2:2>The model learns to map inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs<Point2:2>.,"Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. This means that the input data comes with the correct output, which allows the model to learn by example. The model makes predictions and is corrected by the labels, refining its accuracy over time.
<Point1:2> *True* (The student correctly explains that supervised learning uses labeled data for training.)\n
<Point2:2> *True* (The student accurately describes the process where the model learns from examples and improves over time.)\n","Supervised learning is a method where the computer teaches itself without any input or labels. The model figures out the right answers by itself over time.
<Point1:2> *False* (The student incorrectly describes supervised learning as a process without input or labels, which is inaccurate.)\n
<Point2:2> *False* (The student fails to mention that supervised learning relies on labeled data and instead confuses it with unsupervised learning.)\n","In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled examples. It's a process where the computer gets better at making predictions over time by comparing its guesses to the correct answers.
<Point1:2> *True* (The student correctly identifies that supervised learning involves labeled examples.)\n
<Point2:2> *False* (The explanation of how the model learns is somewhat vague and lacks detail about the process of refining accuracy.)\n"
INT002,Explain the difference between classification and regression.,3,"Classification and regression <Point1:1>differ in the type of output they predict<Point1:1>. <Point2:1>Classification predicts discrete labels (categories)<Point2:1>, whereas <Point3:1>regression predicts continuous quantities<Point3:1>.","Classification and regression differ in the type of output they predict. Classification is used to predict discrete labels or categories, such as whether an email is spam or not. Regression, on the other hand, is used to predict continuous quantities, like the price of a house based on various features.
<Point1:2> *True* (The student correctly explains that classification deals with discrete labels, while regression deals with continuous quantities.)\n
<Point2:1> *True* (The student provides clear examples for both classification and regression, enhancing the explanation.)\n
<Point3:1> *True* (The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the difference between the two concepts.)\n","Classification and regression are both ways to categorize data, but they do it in different ways.

<Point1:2> *False* (The student gives a vague explanation without specifying that classification predicts discrete labels and regression predicts continuous values.)\n
<Point2:1> *False* (The student does not provide any examples to clarify the concepts.)\n
<Point3:1> *False* (The explanation lacks depth and fails to accurately differentiate between classification and regression.)\n","Classification is when you predict categories, and regression is about predicting values.

<Point2:2> *True* (The student's answer accurately explains that overfitting leads to poor performance on new data because the model fails to generalize.)\n","Overfitting is when a model is too complex and works too well on the training data, but it's not good at making predictions on new data.
<Point1:2> *False* (The student's answer incorrectly emphasizes that overfitting is solely about the model being ""too complex,"" which doesn't fully capture the issue. It misses the key aspect that overfitting occurs because the model learns the noise and details in the training data.)\n
<Point2:2> *False* (The answer does not clearly explain how overfitting negatively impacts the model's performance on new data due to a lack of generalization, only vaguely mentioning that the model ""is not good"" at making predictions on new data.)\n","Overfitting in machine learning is when a model performs exceptionally well on training data but poorly on new data because it has learned too much from the training data, including the noise.
<Point1:2> *True* (The student's answer correctly identifies that overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data due to learning too much, including the noise.)\n

INT006,"Which is more important to you – model accuracy, or model performance?",5,"Well, <Point1:1>it has everything to do with how model accuracy is only a subset of model performance, and at that, a sometimes misleading one<Point1:1>. <Point2:2>For example, if you wanted to detect fraud in a massive dataset with a sample of millions, a more accurate model would most likely predict no fraud at all if only a vast minority of cases were fraud<Point2:2>. <Point3:2>However, this would be useless for a predictive model - a model designed to find fraud that asserted there was no fraud at all! Questions like this help you demonstrate that you understand model accuracy isn’t the be-all and end-all of model performance.<Point3:2>","Model accuracy is important, but model performance is more critical because accuracy is just one aspect of performance. For example, in cases where the dataset is imbalanced, a high accuracy might not reflect the true effectiveness of the model. Performance metrics like F1 score, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC provide a more comprehensive understanding of how well the model works.

<Point3:1> *True* (The student demonstrates understanding by mentioning other performance metrics that provide a more complete picture.)\n","Model accuracy is definitely the most important because it shows how often the model is correct. If a model has high accuracy, it is performing well.
<Point1:2> *False* (The student incorrectly assumes that model accuracy is the sole indicator of model performance, without considering that accuracy can be misleading.)\n
<Point2:1> *False* (The student does not provide an example or acknowledge potential issues like imbalanced datasets.)\n
<Point3:1> *False* (The student fails to demonstrate a deeper understanding of model performance metrics.)\n","Model performance is what matters most, but accuracy is also very important.

<Point2:1> *False* (The student makes a general statement but doesn't provide a clear example to illustrate the point.)\n

INT007,What evaluation approaches would you work to gauge the effectiveness of a machine learning model?,5,"<Point1:2>First split the dataset into training and test sets, or perhaps use cross-validation techniques to further segment the dataset into composite sets of training and test sets within the data<Point1:2>. Then implement a choice selection of performance metrics. You could use measures such as the <Point2:1>F1 score<Point2:1>, <Point3:1>the accuracy<Point3:1>, and the <Point4:1>confusion matrix<Point4:1>.","To gauge the effectiveness of a machine learning model, I would first split the dataset into training and test sets, or possibly use cross-validation techniques to create multiple subsets.
