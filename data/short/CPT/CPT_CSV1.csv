CPT001,What are the key phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?,12,"The key phases of the SDLC are: <Point1:1>Requirement Gathering<Point1:1>: <Point2:1>Collecting requirements from stakeholders to understand what needs to be developed<Point2:1>. <Point3:1>System Analysis and Design<Point3:1>: <Point4:1>Analyzing the requirements and creating a blueprint of the system<Point4:1>. <Point5:1>Implementation (Coding) <Point5:1>: <Point6:1>Writing the code as per the design documents<Point6:1>. <Point7:1>Testing<Point7:1>: <Point8:1>Verifying the system against the requirements to identify and fix defects<Point8:1>. <Point9:1>Deployment<Point9:1>: <Point10:1>Releasing the software to the production environment for users<Point10:1>. <Point11:1>Maintenance<Point11:1>: <Point12:1>Ongoing support and enhancement of the software post-deployment<Point12:1>.
"
CPT002,What is the difference between the Waterfall model and the Agile model?,9,"Waterfall Model:<Point1:2>A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins<Point1:2>. <Point2:1> The process flows in one direction like a waterfall, moving from one phase to the next without overlapping or iteration<Point2:1>. <Point3:1>Difficulty in Changes: Changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed, as it requires revisiting and potentially redoing previous phases<Point3:1>.
Agile Model: <Point4:2>An iterative and incremental approach that focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback<Point4:2>. <Point5:1> Development occurs in small, manageable increments called iterations<Point5:1>, which allow for regular reassessment and adaptation. <Point6:1> Agile allows for continuous feedback from stakeholders and adaptability to changing requirements throughout the development process<Point6:1>. <Point7:1>Changes can be made at any stage of the development process, accommodating evolving requirements and priorities<Point7:1>.
"
CPT003,What is cohesion? And what is high and low,8,"Cohesion indicates the <Point1:2>bond strength between elements in a module<Point1:2>. It measures the <Point2:1>relationship strength between the data of a class/methods<Point2:1> and <Point3:1>the unifying factor or purpose the class serves<Point3:1>. High cohesion means that <Point4:2>the elements within a module are closely related and work together towards a common goal<Point4:2>, while low cohesion implies that <Point5:2>the elements are loosely related and do not have a clear or unified purpose<Point5:2>."
CPT004,What are internal milestones in software engineering?,11,"Internal milestones are <Point1:2>measurable and important attributes of processes<Point1:2>. They are <Point2:1>standard systematic procedures<Point2:1> that <Point3:1>indicate that the engineers are on the right path<Point3:1>. These milestones can be used to <Point4:2>assess the development team's progress<Point4:2>, <Point5:1>identify issues and risks<Point5:1>, and <Point6:1>make necessary adjustments to the project plan<Point6:1>. They can be related to various aspects of the project, such as <Point7:1>completing a specific feature<Point7:1>, <Point8:1>testing and debugging the code<Point8:1>, or <Point9:1>reaching a certain level of performance or functionality<Point9:1>."
CPT005,What is the Rapid Application Development (RAD) model?,6,"The RAD model is an <Point1:1>iterative and prototyping approach<Point1:1> to software development that<Point2:1>emphasizes less time spent on traditional planning phases and more on software development<Point2:1>. It involves a <Point3:1>series of smaller development cycles, including planning, design, construction, and testing<Point3:1>, with a focus on <Point4:1>quick delivery of functional software to clients and stakeholders<Point4:1>. The RAD model incorporates <Point5:2>feedback from end-users and stakeholders to refine and improve the software<Point5:2>."
CPT006,"What are strong and weak typing, and which would you recommend?",5,"<Point1:1>Weak typing checks the types of variables in a system at run time<Point1:1>, while <Point2:1>strong typing checks the types of variables at compilation time<Point2:1>. <Point3:1>Strong typing is recommended because it reduces bugs<Point3:1>. However, it can also <Point4:1>make the code more rigid and harder to modify<Point4:1>. Eventually, the choice <Point5:1>depends on your project requirements<Point5:1>."
CPT007,Why do you think using catch (exception) is a bad idea?,6,"I think it is a bad idea because of these reasons: It <Point1:1>cannot be used when exception types are not known<Point1:1>. <Point2:1>Because if there are no variables defined, the exception is hard to read<Point2:1>. It can <Point3:1>lead to unexpected behavior<Point3:1> if <Point4:1>the code is modified later <Point4:1> and <Point5:1>new exceptions are introduced<Point5:1>, as they may also <Point6:1>be caught by the catch (exception) block and handled inappropriately<Point6:1>."
CPT008,"You are developing control software for a car whose latest model will have a network connection. Software upgrades will be delivered over the air rather than at service visits, so that any security vulnerabilities can be patched quickly. This in turn means that you will have to provide patches, to deal with both security and safety issues for the next 25 years. Discuss how this is likely to affect your development process, and the implications it will have for costs. ",15,"As a software developer, there are several implications that the over-the-air software upgrade strategy will have on your development process and costs: Long-term Support: <Point1:1>To provide patches and upgrades over the air for 25 years<Point1:1>, <Point2:1>the development process must include long-term support mechanisms<Point2:1>. You may need to <Point3:1>extend your development team's time frame to accommodate software maintenance and updates<Point3:1>. Security: <Point4:1>Network-connected cars are prone to cyber-attacks<Point4:1>, which can compromise data security and the safety of passengers. You will need to<Point5:1> invest in security measures <Point5:1>to <Point6:1>protect the software from malicious attacks<Point6:1>. Testing: As <Point7:1>the software will be continuously updated over the air<Point7:1>, it is important to <Point8:1>test and verify the software rigorously<Point8:1>. <Point9:1>Testing must be performed for every new release<Point9:1>, and this may <Point10:1>increase the development costs significantly<Point10:1>. Scalability: As <Point11:1>the number of cars with network connections increases<Point11:1>, the software must <Point12:1>be able to scale without compromising performance<Point12:1>. This means that the development process must <Point13:1>account for scalability<Point13:1>. Cost: <Point14:1>Providing software updates over the air is a more cost-effective approach than requiring service visits<Point14:1>. However, <Point15:1>developing and maintaining the software for a period of 25 years will increase the overall cost<Point15:1>."
