CPT001,What are the key phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?,12,"The key phases of the SDLC are: <Point1:1>Requirement Gathering<Point1:1>: <Point2:1>Collecting requirements from stakeholders to understand what needs to be developed<Point2:1>. <Point3:1>System Analysis and Design<Point3:1>: <Point4:1>Analyzing the requirements and creating a blueprint of the system<Point4:1>. <Point5:1>Implementation (Coding) <Point5:1>: <Point6:1>Writing the code as per the design documents<Point6:1>. <Point7:1>Testing<Point7:1>: <Point8:1>Verifying the system against the requirements to identify and fix defects<Point8:1>. <Point9:1>Deployment<Point9:1>: <Point10:1>Releasing the software to the production environment for users<Point10:1>. <Point11:1>Maintenance<Point11:1>: <Point12:1>Ongoing support and enhancement of the software post-deployment<Point12:1>.

CPT002,What is the difference between the Waterfall model and the Agile model?,9,"Waterfall Model:<Point1:2>A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins<Point1:2>. <Point2:1> The process flows in one direction like a waterfall, moving from one phase to the next without overlapping or iteration<Point2:1>. <Point3:1>Difficulty in Changes: Changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed, as it requires revisiting and potentially redoing previous phases<Point3:1>.
Agile Model: <Point4:2>An iterative and incremental approach that focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback<Point4:2>. <Point5:1> Development occurs in small, manageable increments called iterations<Point5:1>, which allow for regular reassessment and adaptation. <Point6:1> Agile allows for continuous feedback from stakeholders and adaptability to changing requirements throughout the development process<Point6:1>. <Point7:1>Changes can be made at any stage of the development process, accommodating evolving requirements and priorities<Point7:1>.

CPT003,What is cohesion? And what is high and low,8,"Cohesion indicates the <Point1:2>bond strength between elements in a module<Point1:2>. It measures the <Point2:1>relationship strength between the data of a class/methods<Point2:1> and <Point3:1>the unifying factor or purpose the class serves<Point3:1>. High cohesion means that <Point4:2>the elements within a module are closely related and work together towards a common goal<Point4:2>, while low cohesion implies that <Point5:2>the elements are loosely related and do not have a clear or unified purpose<Point5:2>."
CPT004,What are internal milestones in software engineering?,11,"Internal milestones are <Point1:2>measurable and important attributes of processes<Point1:2>. They are <Point2:1>standard systematic procedures<Point2:1> that <Point3:1>indicate that the engineers are on the right path<Point3:1>. These milestones can be used to <Point4:2>assess the development team's progress<Point4:2>, <Point5:1>identify issues and risks<Point5:1>, and <Point6:1>make necessary adjustments to the project plan<Point6:1>. They can be related to various aspects of the project, such as <Point7:1>completing a specific feature<Point7:1>, <Point8:1>testing and debugging the code<Point8:1>, or <Point9:1>reaching a certain level of performance or functionality<Point9:1>."
CPT005,What is the Rapid Application Development (RAD) model?,6,"The RAD model is an <Point1:1>iterative and prototyping approach<Point1:1> to software development that<Point2:1>emphasizes less time spent on traditional planning phases and more on software development<Point2:1>. It involves a <Point3:1>series of smaller development cycles, including planning, design, construction, and testing<Point3:1>, with a focus on <Point4:1>quick delivery of functional software to clients and stakeholders<Point4:1>. The RAD model incorporates <Point5:2>feedback from end-users and stakeholders to refine and improve the software<Point5:2>."
