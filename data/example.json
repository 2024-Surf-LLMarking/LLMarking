      "question": "What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm in the worst case?",
      "referenceAnswer": "In the worst case, the time complexity of QuickSort is O(n²), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs when the pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest element in the array, leading to unbalanced partitions.",
      "studentAnswer": "QuickSort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case because it divides the list into two halves."

      "question": "Explain how a hash table works.",
      "referenceAnswer": "A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ some form of collision resolution.",
      "studentAnswer": "A hash table is just an array that stores data and uses keys for indexing."

      "question": "Describe the basic components of a distributed system.",
      "referenceAnswer": "A distributed system consists of multiple software components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Key components include servers, clients, and the communication infrastructure.",
      "studentAnswer": "Distributed systems are just multiple computers connected to a server that manages them."

      "question": "What is refactoring in software development?",
      "referenceAnswer": "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior. It is done to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software, such as readability, reduced complexity, or improving maintainability and scalability.",
      "studentAnswer": "Refactoring is when you write new functions to add more features to the software."
