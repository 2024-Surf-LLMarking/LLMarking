CPTA3a,"An automated ticket-issuing system sells rail tickets. The user selects his destination and inputs a credit card and a personal identification number. The rail ticket is issued and charged to their credit card account. To begin, the user presses the start button. The system activates a menu displaying the potential destinations and sends a message to the user to select a destination. Once the user selects a destination, the system requests the user to insert his credit card. The system checks the credit card validity and requires the user to input a personal identifier. When the credit transaction is validated by the credit card center, the ticket is issued. If the user enters an invalid personal identifier for the credit card, the system will prompt the user and terminate the transaction. The above statement is extracted from a customer during requirement discovery. If the
